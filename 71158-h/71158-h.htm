</div>

<p>The importance of the three main textiles in the civilized life of today
is probably but vaguely realized by the majority of people. In this
country we consume raw cotton alone at the rate of about twenty-six
pounds per capita each year, which if translated to yards of cloth and
other fabric, would make a strip longer than the distance from the earth
to the moon, and a yard wide all the way. Add wool and silk to this and
the picture becomes even more impressive. There is not a man, woman
or child who does not use one or all three of these textiles in daily life.
With this in mind we submit this brief description of how they are produced,
emphasizing in particular the development of the raw material
in each case.</p>

<p>Parts I and II are practically revised editions of “Cotton and Cotton
Manufacture” and “Wool and Wool Manufacture” which were written
by James Paul Warburg in 1921 and 1920, respectively, and published
by the First National Bank of Boston, with whom he was then associated.
We take this occasion to acknowledge the extreme courtesy of the First
National Bank of Boston in allowing the use of this material. Part III,
dealing with Silk, has been newly compiled by Benjamin Strong, Jr., of
the International Acceptance Bank, Inc.</p>

<p>No attempt has been made in these studies to enter very deeply into
the technical processes involved, the purpose being more to give a condensed
outline of the subject from the layman’s point of view. While
actual survey and observation were extensively made in each case, a
great part of the material has of necessity been obtained from standard
works on these subjects. In this connection we wish especially to render
acknowledgment to Professor M. T. Copeland of Harvard University,
whose studies were freely used by the author of Part I on Cotton. In the
case of Silk, we are particularly grateful to Mr. W. D. Darby, whose
“Silk, The Queen of Fabrics” has been of invaluable assistance. To the
many friends in the textile trades who have provided opportunities for
first hand observation, as well as a wealth of information, we tender our
sincere thanks and grateful appreciation.</p>

THE RAW MATERIAL</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Cotton Plant</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Derivation
of Names</em></div>

<p>The word, “Cotton”, is said to be derived from an Arabic word,
“Qutun”, originally meaning flax; and the botanical name of the plant,
Gossypium, signifying the fleece worn, was first found in the writings of
Pliny, and is derived from the Sanskrit. Thus, in the mere origins of the
colloquial and scientific designations of the plant, we have ample proof
of its antiquity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Botanical
Types</em></div>

<p>The cotton plant belongs to the mallow family and is a native of the
tropics. The genus has a great many botanical varieties, all of which, in
the wild state, are perennial, but under cultivation tend to become annual.
One variety, Gossypium Arboreum, which is found chiefly in
Mexico and Brazil, attains a height of over fifteen feet. This tree cotton,
however, has not been extensively cultivated because of the obvious expense
of picking. Of the herbaceous varieties the most commonly known
are the American and the long-staple Egyptian. G. Barbadense, known
as Sea Island cotton, is another long staple variety which is grown only
in certain counties of Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The
Cotton
Plant</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Fibre</em></div>

<p>In all the cultivated species the plant attains a height of two to four
feet. The leaves vary, but all have characteristic lobes. The blossoms
also vary a good deal in color, but have this in common that the seeds
are contained in a pod or boll which is filled with a floss not unlike that
of the common milk-weed. In due course the boll bursts, exposing the
mass of fluffy fibre from which the plant derives its extraordinary value.
The superiority of cotton over other vegetable fibres, such as hemp or
flax, is in the natural twist, which makes it inherently adaptable to spinning.
The single fibre consists of a hollow tube having transverse joints
at irregular intervals, and this tube, when dry, has a tendency to flatten
out and curl. The more of this natural elasticity is found in the fibre the
better it is for spinning purposes, and an immature fibre is for this reason
unsatisfactory. Cotton is exceedingly susceptible to moisture, and a
succession of violent atmospheric changes will cause such a rapid contraction
and expansion in its fibre as to destroy its elasticity. From
the point of view of the manufacturer there is very little difference between
immature cotton and that which has suffered loss of vitality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Seeds
and
Stems</em></div>

<p>Besides yielding a natural wool from which a tremendous number of
products are derived, the seed of the plant gives forth a highly useful
vegetable oil, and the stems and leaves are used for fodder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">History and Distribution</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Ancient
History</em></div>

<p>The origin of the cultivation and commercial use of cotton is shrouded
in the dim veils of antiquity. The records of India show that the plant
was grown, and its fibre utilized, from the earliest times. The Phoenicians
and the Hebrews are known to have made cotton clothing, and later
the art was transmitted by them to the Greeks and Romans. The vague
annals of China indicate a familiarity with this plant and its value extending
back to the remote past, and the same is true of Japan. Cortez
found a flourishing textile industry among the Aztecs in 1519, and in
Peru, Pizarro found cotton garments said to antedate the civilization of
the Incas. Again early Portuguese chroniclers relate the discovery of
native cotton in Brazil.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Europe</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>America</em></div>

<p>The Arabs and Saracens were largely responsible for the introduction
of the textile industries to western Europe in the ninth century, but
it was not until about the middle of the seventeenth century that any
great progress was made. During this time the British began to attempt
the cultivation of cotton in their colonies, and it was about 1650 when
the first Virginia plantations were begun. Since that time the United
States has forged ahead until at present it grows over three-fifths of the
world’s crop.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Egypt</em></div>

<p>The cultivation of cotton in Egypt was begun about 1821, American
Sea Island seeds being imported at that time. The fertile alluvial soil of
the Nile delta was found particularly adapted to this use, and extensive
irrigation later expanded the area. The construction of the Great
Assouan Dam late in the nineteenth century gave a tremendous impetus
to the industry. Egyptian cotton is mostly of the long staple variety, the
best, known as Sakellarides, averaging an inch and three-quarters.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>India</em></div>

<p>Cotton culture in India is perhaps the oldest of all, but Indian cotton
is of the short staple variety, and can only be used by certain manufacturers
most of which are located in Japan and Germany. About twenty-five
million acres are said to be under cultivation, but statistics are very
meagre.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>China</em></div>

<p>China has long been a large grower of cotton, but the native species
are of a harsh, short fibre. Korea and the Yangtze and Wei basins are
the chief sources, and American cotton has recently been introduced in
the southern provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Other
Countries</em></div>

<p>Russia began to raise American cotton on a large scale in Turkestan
only some twenty years ago, and bids fair to become a large producer.
The plant is indigenous to almost all the Central and South American
countries, and particularly in Mexico, Brazil and Peru, it has great
potentialities. Peru has two kinds of native cotton known as the rough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
and smooth varieties. The former is of a very long and tough fibre and
is valuable because it can be blended with wool.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>American
Varieties</em></div>

<p>The greatest part of the American crop consists of the Upland variety,
although, as we have noted, there is a small but important crop of Sea
Island in the Southern Atlantic states. Another long staple species,
known as Pimas, has recently been introduced in Arizona, and the
alluvial soil of Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana has produced still
other desirable species, locally known as “Rivers,” “Peelers,” and
“Benders.” Before we consider the relative manufacturing merits of the
various kinds of cotton, it would perhaps be well to consider briefly
how the crop is grown.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Cultivation</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Growth of
the plant</em></div>

<p>The cotton season of course varies in different latitudes, but the planting
is done everywhere in the early spring months. The proper care and
fertilization of the soil and its preparation to receive the seed is of the
utmost importance. The plant ripens in about four months, so that the
picking season in this country usually begins in August, and continues
until the first killing frost. From the time of the opening of the first
bolls the cotton continues to grow, unless killed by drought or insects,
until the cold puts a stop to vegetation, and the same stalk frequently
contains ripe and immature cotton at the same time. The cotton which
matures first and has been least exposed to weather when picked is likely
to be freer of spots and discolorations than that which is picked at the
end of the season.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Enemies of
the plant</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Boll
Weevil</em></div>

<p>The two great enemies of the cotton plant are drought and insect
depredations. Late frosts and the right quantity of rain and sunshine
are what every cotton planter prays for, and praying is about all he can
do in this respect. Not so, however, with insects. Unfortunately there are
a great number of rapacious little creatures rendered particularly hardy
by some caprice of Nature, to whom the growing cotton plant represents
an especial delicacy. Against them the planters, under the guidance of
the Department of Agriculture, are waging continuous warfare. It is
said that insect depredation, at pre-war prices cost the country an annual
sum of $60,000,000, more than half of which is attributable to the
two worst offenders, the boll weevil and the boll worm. Coming in
hordes across the Mexican border, the boll weevil has destroyed millions
of bales of cotton annually, and as yet no very effective remedy
has been found to exterminate it.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Weather
Defects</em></div>

<p>Even at that, however, the planter’s greatest worry is perhaps not so
much the growth as the harvesting of his crop. To get his cotton picked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
rapidly and properly, an operation for which no successful machinery
has yet been devised, and to have it properly ginned, presents his chief
problem. If cotton is left too long on the stem it will be exposed to the
detrimental effects of the weather. Coloring matter from the newly
opened bolls, or from the soil, is washed into the floss by the rain, and
while such spots or stains may be bleached out by the sun, the lustrous
bloom never returns. Frost will make permanent tinges or stains, and
the wind will frequently wrap the pendulous locks of fibre-covered seed
about the stems of the plant or tangle them up in the leaves.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Careless
Picking</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Bad Ginning</em></div>

<p>When the pickers do not exercise proper care stem and leaves frequently
get picked along with cotton, and a considerable quantity of dirt
inevitably finds its way into their bags. Or else the cotton may be picked
when it is damp, with the result that the teeth of the gin, instead of
picking out the seeds and stems will cut the matted fibres, producing a
class of cotton known as “Gin-cut”. Moreover the gin brushes will be
unable to separate the matted tufts, and so they go into the bale as
“naps” or “neps”. All these factors militate against the planter in his
efforts to have his crop classified as high as possible.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Grades and Staples</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Grades
Based on
Condition</em></div>

<p>The classification of cotton into the standard grades fixed by the
Government constitutes an exceedingly difficult art. There is absolutely
no mechanical basis, and the classification is a purely relative one. The
kind of plant has no bearing whatsoever, nor has the length or strength
of staple. It is really a distinction based upon the condition of the cotton,
rather than upon its inherent attributes.</p>

<p>The grade “MIDDLING” is the basis upon which the market values
of the other grades are quoted. There are eight full grades:</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Full
Grades</em></div>

<table class="autotable" style="width: 60%">

<td class="tdl"><em>Fair</em></td>

</tr>
</table>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Tinges and
Stains</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel">“<em>Points</em>”</div>

<p>Between these full grades are the half grades, known as the Stricts,
and some classers use quarter grades with which, however, we shall not
concern ourselves here. The grades and half-grades are quoted for
whites, tinges, and stains. A stain is a heavy discoloration while a tinge
is a lighter hue, and partial discolorations, known as spots, are permissible
in the lower grades of whites. The values of the various grades are
always quoted as so many points on or off White Middling, a point
being <span class="xs"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>100</sub></span>th. of a cent. Thus, if Middling White were quoted at 24c<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
and Ordinary as 300 points off, it would mean that Ordinary was worth
21c. An example is given below of a regular quotation sheet.</p>

<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Human
Element</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Proportion
of
Impurities</em></div>

<p>It is obvious that in this classification the human element plays a
great part. The difference between quarter grades, or even half grades,
or between a tinge and a stain, are subject to a great variety of interpretations.
While there is no definite standard, Middling must be cream or
white, must show no soil evidence, no gin-cuts or naps, may have a few
pieces of leaf (not powdered), and a few motes, (immature seeds). As
the grades go up the cotton must be freer of impurities until the top
grades have to show practically a perfect lustrous, silky, white, and
clear fibre. On the lower side the impurities increase, until, in the
Ordinaries, we find large and small leaf particles, sticks, hulls, dirt,
sand naps, gin-cuts, and spots, together with a dingy color.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Some
Cottons not
Sold on
Middling Basis</em></div>

<p>It is this classification that governs the trading on all the exchanges,
and upon which the planter originally sells his crop. The exceptions are
those varieties of cotton which are distinct from the crop as a whole. Sea
Islands are sold as Fancy, Choice, Fine, Medium, and Common. Bolly
or immature cotton is sold by separate agreements; and Linters, the
fibres regained by the seed mills from reginning the seed, are not sold
on this basis. Neither is what is known as the “City Crop” of loose cotton
accumulated from taking samples, sold in this way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Staple
Length</em></div>

<p>Aside from grade there are two other qualifications which are of
equal importance to the manufacturer: length, and strength. Lengths are
quoted in eights of an inch, and cotton under 1⅛” is termed short, while
that over 1⅛” is long. The normal lengths run from ¾” to 1⅞”, and it
is noteworthy that, where a normal difference between grades would be
25 points, the difference of ⅛” would be about 250 points. “Pulling”
for staple is another art where the individual’s judgment plays an important
part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Elasticity</em></div>

<p>Strength,—elasticity and tensile strength,—is again one of the mill’s
prerequisites. The usual buyer’s test for fibre vitality is to compress a
sample in the hand to see if it will return to its former shape. The importance
of length is that it governs the fineness of the yarn to be spun,
while grades affect the finish of the cloth. We shall see later that mills
cannot buy mixed lots, but must have even-running grades of fixed
staple.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">Buyers of Raw Cotton</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Storekeepers
as Local
Buyers</em></div>

<p>The small planters of the South are usually unable to finance themselves
independently through the growing and picking seasons. Consequently
the local store-keeper, from whom the planters buy their supplies,
usually extends credit in the form of an open account and so
becomes the first middleman. Not infrequently the store-keeper will accept
cotton rather than money in settlement of his accounts, and where
he follows this practice he becomes what is known as a local buyer.
When he has accumulated sufficient cotton he sells either to an intermediate
buyer, or to the buyer for some merchant or mill.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Large
Growers</em></div>

<p>In the case of the larger grower, or the syndicate of growers, the local
buyer is usually eliminated. These planters obtain their credit from the
large merchant buyers, who in turn are carried by their banks.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Intermediate
Buyers</em></div>

<p>Very frequently the local buyers are scattered so thickly through a
neighborhood, and each accumulate such small and heterogeneous lots
of cotton that an intermediate buyer finds his way into the natural order.
Sometimes the intermediate is merely a “scalper” who buys from the
local dealer and sells to merchant buyers. In other cases, notably in
Texas, he acts as a concentrating agent, buying at local points from
growers and selling, usually at compress points, to representatives of
merchants or mills. In the latter case he is referred to as a “street
buyer.”</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Financing
Early
Stages</em></div>

<p>Where the grower surrenders his cotton to the local dealer the latter
usually has it ginned, but in cases where the planter is able to finance
himself he takes his cotton to the gin himself, pays for the ginning, and
either sells in so-called gin bales, (before they are compressed) or, if a
warehouse is available at the gin or compress point, holds his cotton
until he can obtain a satisfactory price for it. The local banks perform
a very important part of the crop financing at this stage, for, since the
grower sells for cash, the buyers require advances. These are made by
the Southern banks against buyers’ tickets, showing cotton purchased,
against gin receipts, warehouse receipts, compress receipts, and finally
when the cotton is shipped, against bills of lading.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Merchant
Buyer’s
Importance</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Take-up
Man</em></div>

<p>The large cotton merchants fulfill a very essential function in that
they are responsible for the concentration of the raw material and for
its redistribution into the proper channels of manufacture. They maintain
branches and representatives throughout the entire cotton growing
areas and are directly connected by wire with all the important exchanges.
By far the bulk of their buying is done after the close of the
New York Exchange from local and intermediate buyers who during the
day have been acquiring mixed lots of all sorts. The merchant’s representative,
known as the take-up man, goes over and classifies the cotton
accumulated by the local buyers, takes a sample from each bale which
he tags with a duplicate of the shipping tag he places on the bale itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
and then ships the cotton to the concentration point and the samples to
the office at that place. He pays the local buyer by draft or check.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Even-running
Lots from
Compress
Point</em></div>

<p>The office at the concentration point, usually where there is a compress,
has in the meantime received instructions from the head office as
to how to make up the various lots. As the bales are compressed they are
collected into even-running lots of certain grades for which the head
office has received inquiries from mills, and are shipped out in this way.
The branch office will ship according to instructions forwarding the
bills of lading with invoices and sight drafts to the head office or to
some bank.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Cooperative
Marketing</em></div>

<p>Since the war, and particularly in the last three years, the co-operative
movement has in some sections developed to such an extent as
to supplant in large part the old system of marketing. In Texas, Georgia,
and other States, a large part of the crop is now concentrated, financed,
and sold through these extensive organizations of growers either direct
to mills, or to large merchants and exporters.</p>

<p>Almost all cotton is bought on Middling Basis, but some is taken on
sample with guarantees, (often a dangerous practice for both parties),
and some is taken at a fixed price per bale.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Direct
Buying</em></div>

<p>A few Southern mills buy direct from nearby growers, but the preponderant
majority and practically all the Northern mills obtain their
cotton through merchants, or through brokers representing Southern
merchants.</p>

<p>We have seen briefly how the cotton is grown and brought to market,
but we have still to consider the all important question of what determines
the price at which it changes hands.</p>


<h3>6. <span class="smcap">The Cotton Exchanges</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>“Spot”
and
“Futures”</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Great
Markets</em></div>

<p>Cotton trading falls roughly into two categories: trading in cotton for
immediate delivery, or spot cotton; and buying or selling for delivery at
some future time. Purchases or sales of spot cotton mean that cotton
actually will be delivered from vendor to purchaser, but, as we shall see,
trading in futures does not necessarily mean that the contract will be
fulfilled by delivery. The great cotton markets are New York, Liverpool,
New Orleans, Bremen, and Havre. Of these New York is almost entirely
a futures market, while New Orleans is chiefly a spot market. Liverpool,
Bremen, and Havre trade in both spot and futures, but Liverpool is the
European centre for trading in future contracts.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The New York
Cotton
Exchange</em></div>

<p>Only about 2% of the annual crop is sold spot in New York, and yet
it is the prices on the New York Cotton Exchange which govern very
largely the price paid to the grower in the South by the various buyers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
The New York Exchange is the barometer of the American, and to a
large extent, of the world’s cotton trade, because its mechanism works
out the equilibrium between demand and supply; and as this mechanism
consists chiefly of the trading device called the “Hedge”, we shall digress
for a moment to consider its operation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The “Hedge”</em></div>

<p>We might say that hedging is an insurance against fluctuations in cotton
prices by purchase or sale of future contracts for cotton against sale
or purchase made for actual delivery. It consists of nothing more than
of neutralizing the gain or loss which will result from existing delivery
contracts if the price rises or falls before delivery date, by creating an
off-setting loss or gain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>As Used
by the
Merchant</em></div>

<p>Assume, for instance, that a merchant makes a contract with a mill in
July for 100 bales October delivery. He sells at the current price of let
us say 30 cents per pound plus his overhead and profit. In due course he
will obtain his cotton from the South, but in the meantime he covers, or
hedges his contract by buying 100 bales of October futures on the Exchange.
If he has to pay the grower 31 cents for the cotton which he has
sold to the mill for 30 cents, he will on the other hand, be able to sell his
future contract which he bought at 30 cents for 31 cents, so that the loss
on one is neutralized by the gain on the other. Vice versa, he will lose
whatever <em>extra</em> profit he might have made from a falling price.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>By the
Manufacturer</em></div>

<p>In the same way a manufacturer may buy futures against orders he
has accepted for goods, based on the price he expects to pay for his cotton.
Or he may sell futures to protect himself on cotton he has bought
but has not yet covered by cloth contracts. Hedging by manufacturers,
however, particularly in the North, is not a common practice, because
the cloth market is not elastic enough to follow accurately in the wake of
cotton prices, and also because the mill treasurer rarely wants to hedge
cotton in his warehouse, preferring to rely on his own judgment in matters
of purchase.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>By the
Grower</em></div>

<p>Occasionally a grower may find it to his advantage to hedge his crop.
If, for example, he is satisfied in August that the present price for December
is likely to be higher than he will obtain later, he may sell
December futures for a conservative percentage of his crop, thereby
guaranteeing himself against a drop.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Speculation</em></div>

<p>By far the greatest part of the future trading, however, is done by
merchants, because they are actually engaged in the business of selling
cotton which they have not yet acquired or of carrying cotton for which
they have no contracts. Speculation, of course, enters into the dealings
on the exchanges as an important economic factor, in normal times
tending to stabilize by discounting future trends, but in periods of extraordinary
demand or supply frequently causing violent fluctuations in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
prices. At such times there is always a good deal of agitation for preventive
legislation, but it is unlikely that dealing in futures will ever be
prohibited by law. The present regulations of the large exchanges eliminate
abuse as far as possible, and the futures markets are really a factor
of safety for the entire industry.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The
Dissemination
of
Quotations</em></div>

<p>All the large merchants, as we have seen, have branch offices in the
South, and all these offices have wire connections with the chief markets.
On the basis of the Liverpool quotations and the New York opening
prices the head offices will send out to their branches and representatives
their daily limits, above which they are instructed not to buy. Inasmuch
as most of the small growers are dependent for their news of the
markets upon the buyers, they are at somewhat of a disadvantage, but
the keenness of competition prevents their exploitation by unscrupulous
buyers.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>New York
Cotton Contract</em></div>

<p>A contract on the New York Cotton Exchange calling for the delivery
of 100 bales specifies Middling grade, but the seller may deliver any
grades which are tenderable by the Exchange regulations. These grades
are from Strict Low Middling to Middling Fair, but if tinged, not below
Middling Tinged. Stains are not tenderable. The grades are determined
and settlement made on the basis of so many points on or off Middling,
which, as we have seen, is the basis for all quotations.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Buying
Season</em></div>

<p>It is evident that mills, which require certain even-running grades,
could of course never buy their cotton on the Middling basis. For this
reason, except in the few cases where they buy direct from the growers,
mills purchase their requirements from dealers on the basis of samples.
Selling to mills, as opposed to selling M/B, is known as selling on
merit. Mills usually begin to buy in September and fill about 60% of
their year’s requirements by January. Those manufacturers who use the
high grades usually buy earliest because of the limited crop from which
they must obtain their share. Cotton is ordinarily shipped soon after
purchase and stored not by the merchant but at the mill. The recent
growth of Southern warehouse companies, however, has caused mills to
carry less cotton than formerly. Mills ordinarily pay for their cotton in
three days.</p>

<p>We have now traced rapidly how the cotton is grown and marketed,
and our next concern will be to follow what happens to it during the
process of making it into goods. Deferring for the moment consideration
of cotton export from the United States, we shall proceed in Chapter
Two, to glance at the various aspects of Cotton Manufacture.</p>

THE MANUFACTURE OF COTTON</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">History in the U. S.</span></h3>

<p>Much has been written on the subject of the textile industry and perhaps
even more still remains to be said. It is not the object of this brief
survey to present a complete picture of all the stages of manufacture,
but rather to place briefly before the reader a necessarily kaleidoscopic
view of the various processes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Slater’s
Mills</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Whitney’s
Gin</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Stimulus of
War of 1812</em></div>

<p>Although the first cotton mill in the United States was founded in
Rhode Island by Samuel Slater in 1790, Whitney’s invention of the
cotton gin in 1793 marked the real beginning of the cotton growing and
manufacturing industries in this country, because it solved the hitherto
vexatious problem of separating the fibre from the seed. Nevertheless,
until the war of 1812, this country exported almost all of its cotton to
Great Britain, and imported from there its cotton goods. The war stimulated
the textile industry for two reasons: first, because no British goods
were available; and second, because it brought about the transference
of New England capital from ships and commerce to home manufacturing
industries. The census figures for 1805 show 4,500 spindles in the
country; in 1825 there were 800,000.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Growth to
1860</em></div>

<p>Various inventions, notably Lowell’s power loom in 1814, and Jenck’s
ring spindle in 1830, made it possible for the New England manufacturer
to compete with the skilled labor of England, and up to the time
of the Civil War the industry made rapid strides. In 1831 795 establishments
with 1,200,000 spindles used 77,800,000 pounds of cotton and
manufactured $32,000,000 worth of goods. Thirty years later there were
1091 mills with 5,200,000 spindles using 422,700,000 pounds of cotton
and making a product worth $115,700,000. At this time 570 of the mills
were in New England, 340 in the Middle Atlantic States, 159 in the
South, and 22 in the Western States. The New England mills, however,
averaged twice as many spindles as the others, and Massachusetts and
Rhode Island alone contained 48% of the total.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Civil War</em></div>

<p>Home industries at this time supplied most of the coarse drills and
sheetings, while the fine goods were imported from England. There was
a small export trade of coarse goods to Asia. The Civil War cut off the
industrial centers from their raw material so that for five years no
progress was made, and when normal life was resumed a new tendency
towards concentration became manifest. From then on the number of
plants decreased and the individual establishment grew larger, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
in 1880 there were fewer mills and four and one-half times as many
spindles as twenty years before.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Rapid
Industrial
Rise of the
South</em></div>

<p>While we shall discuss the geographical distribution of the industry
in a later chapter, it is worthy of note here that the feature of the period
beginning about 1880 and extending to the present time, was the gradual
growth of the spinning and weaving industry in the South. The social
and economic system in the Southern states before the abolition of
slavery made those states entirely agrarian, but as soon as a recovery
from the war was accomplished, manufacturing, and particularly cotton
manufacturing, grew up surprisingly fast. A glance at the growth in
spindlage in the United States from 1880 to 1923 will suffice to illustrate.
Sixty per cent. of the increase since 1880 was in the South. The
units represent millions of spindles.</p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Making Cotton Yarn</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Bale</em></div>

<p>Almost all cotton comes to the mill in standard compress bales of
five hundred pounds gross. The cotton is condensed to about 22 pounds
per cubic foot at the compress, wrapped in coarse jute bagging, and
circled with iron hoops. For some time there has been a movement to
improve the so-called square bale, or to replace it with a different form
of packing. Sea Island cotton is frequently packed in a smaller round
bale, and there is much to be said for this practice. What we are concerned
with here, however, is that the mill receives the cotton in a compressed
form which must be loosened before anything can be done
with it.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><span class="smcap">The Bale-Breaker</span></div>

<p>Accordingly, the first thing that happens is that the hoops are cut, the
bagging removed, and the cotton thrown by hand into the feed-apron of
the bale-breaker. This machine does nothing more than to pick the compressed
cotton apart and deliver it in tufts about the size of a handfull
on a belt conveyor.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Opener</em></div>

<p>The travelling belt or feeder delivers these bunches of cotton into
machines called Openers, which simply repeat the operation of the bale-breaker
on a more thorough scale, reducing the large tufts into many
smaller ones. These small pieces are dropped into an air chute and
drawn along parallel rods up to the picker room. During transit in the
trunk much of the heavier dirt falls between the rods and is removed.</p>

<p>In the most recent installations larger bale-breakers are used which
reduce the cotton to small tufts and deliver through an air pipe to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
condenser in the picker-room. The condenser either empties into bins or
else on to the automatic feed of the breaker-pickers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Pickers

<p>As the tufts come out of the chute they fall into the first of three machines
known as Pickers, whose function is to beat out the coarser impurities
and deliver the cotton in rolls of batting called laps. In the first,
or breaker-picker the tufts are thoroughly whirled and pounded over
grid-bars by rollers armed with short flail-like projections, and then
compressed into a continuous sheet or lap of a given weight per yard,
which is wound on a large spool and delivered to the second, or intermediate
picker. This machine practically repeats the operation only that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
it combines four laps from the first picker into one which it hands over
to the last, or finisher picker. The latter again takes four intermediate
laps and forms them into one sheet of fairly clean cotton, containing
very little dirt or seed, but still fairly filled with small particles of leaf.
In these preliminary operations the cotton has lost about five per cent.
of its weight.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The
Function
of the
Card</em></div>

<p>Before anything else can be done it is now necessary to remove the
leaf particles, and to separate the individual fibres from their matted
position. Both these functions are performed by the machine known as
the Card, the principle of which is that of two surfaces armed with fine
wire teeth revolving not quite tangent to each other. Originally carding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
was performed by hand, but the Wellman carding machine was one of
the earliest textile inventions. This was considerably improved by the
revolving flat card in 1857, the operation of which is somewhat as
follows.</p>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Its
Operation</em></div>

<p>The lap from the finisher picker is fed over a plate on to a revolving
cylinder bearing wire teeth, which combs it over a set of knives, thereby
removing coarse dirt, and passes it on to a large cylinder armed with
millions of fine wire teeth. The latter carries the cotton past a slowly
revolving endless chain of flats which remove the neps and fine dirt.
The clean, separated fibres are then picked off the cylinder by a smaller
rapidly revolving roller called the doffer, which carries them in a filmy
sheet to be in turn removed by the doffing comb. The latter, working so
rapidly that the eye fails to see it, lifts the sheet of fibres clear so that
it may be passed through a funnel and condensed into a single untwisted
rope a little under an inch in diameter. This rope is called a sliver, and
is automatically coiled into a can like an umbrella-stand.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Counts of
Yarn</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Two
Processes</em></div>

<p>We have now for the first time reduced the raw material to a continuous
strand, comparatively free from impurities. Up to this point, no
matter what kind of yarn is to be spun, the operations are practically
identical, but from here on the processes vary according to the product
desired. A hank of yarn is 840 yards (not to be confused with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>worsted hank of 560 yards) and the number of hanks it takes to make a
pound is the basis upon which yarn is classified. Thus a coarse yarn
which weighs only twenty hanks to the pound, would be called 20s,
while 80s would be a very fine yarn. Various fabrics require different
grades of yarn, just as different finenesses of yarn must be spun from
varying grades of cotton. The processes preparatory to spinning vary,
not only with the counts to be spun, but with the use to which the yarn is
to be put. Ordinary coarse and medium yarns for weaving usually follow
one process, while fine counts for weaving, or knitting yarn, or
coarse yarn made from long-staple cotton such as that used for tire-duck,
go through a different preparation. The former are simply drawn
and reduced, while the latter are in addition combed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>First
Process</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Drawing</em></div>

<p>In the ordinary process, which is by far the most commonly used, the
sliver from the card is put through successive similar operations, known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
as drawing, the object of which is to draw out the fibres and cause them
to lie parallel to each other. Six card slivers are fed together between
two pairs of rollers, the second of which is revolving faster than the
first. The obvious result of this is the stretching of that portion of the
slivers which is between the two sets of rollers. The operation is usually
performed two or three times, in each case combining six strands into
one. The sliver delivered by the third drawing machine will be of the
same diameter as the original card sliver, but will contain more or less
parallel fibres.</p>
<br>

Operations</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Slubber</em></div>

<p>There remains now only one series of operations before the yarn is
ready to be spun. The sliver must be reduced in size and given a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
amount of twist; these objects are accomplished by the roving frames,
of which there are either three or four. The first, or slubber, passes the
drawn sliver through rollers without combining, and winds it up on
bobbins set in spindles. The sliver is twisted by being fed onto the bobbin
by an arm, or flyer, which revolves a little more slowly than the
spindle, being drawn around after it. The result is a slightly twisted
sliver, now called a roving, about the diameter of a clothes-line.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Four Stages of Roving</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The intermediate, fine frame, and jack frame,—or, if there are only
three roving boxes, the intermediate and fine frames,—combine two rovings
into one of smaller size and more twist. The mechanism is much the
same, except that in each successive frame the spindles are smaller and
revolve faster, until finally the thread is small enough to spin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Second
Process</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Lapper</em></div>

<p>Where it is desired to spin special kinds or very fine yarns twenty
card slivers are usually combined in a machine similar to a drawing
frame and known as a sliver-lapper. The twenty ends are drawn between
rollers and delivered not as we should expect in one strand, but in a
narrow band or lap, which is wound on spools. Four of these laps are
again combined and drawn over a spiral surface in the ribbon lapper
which delivers its product to the comb. The cotton is now in a band less
than a foot wide, with fibres more or less parallel and practically clean.
Since it is desired to spin a yarn which demands not only parallel but
uniform fibres, the short fibres must be eliminated.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Comb</em></div>

<p>There are a considerable number of combing machines in use at the
present time, but their differences are mechanical rather than in the
function they perform. The Heilmann principle is the most commonly
used in this country. Eight rolls from the ribbon-lapper are placed in
separate rests, or heads, end to end, and each lap is fed through rollers
between teeth of a very fine and rapidly oscillating steel comb. Every
back and forth motion, known as a nip, delivers about half an inch of
filmy sheet from which the short fibres have been combed out. The eight
combed sheets are then once more condensed into a single sliver and
coiled into a cylindrical can.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Drawing</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Doublings</em></div>

<p>Following the comb there are usually two drawing frames, each combining
six slivers into one, and these are followed by the three or four
roving frames as in the other process. In the ordinary process the last
roving as it leaves the jack frame has been doubled 27,648 times; in the
combed yarn there are 2,959,120 doublings before spinning begins.</p>

<p>Spinning proper is done either on the mule or the ring spindle. Very
little cotton is spun on mules in this country, although mules are extensively
used in Europe. We shall concern ourselves here only with the
ring spindle, and that in bare outline. (See also Part Two, Page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>).</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Ring
Frame</em></div>

<p>The principle of the ring frame is very similar to that of the roving
operations which immediately precede it. The thread is again drawn
through two or three sets of rollers running at successively higher rates
of speed, and then passes as shown on the accompanying sketch through
a guide to a small metal loop, called the traveller, which runs around on
a metal track or ring within which the spindle with its bobbin is revolving.
Since the spindle pulls the traveller around after it, the yarn is
twisted or spun as it is wound on the bobbin. Sometimes two spools of
roving are spun into a single thread, but more frequently there is no
combination. All the rings on one frame, usually about 256, are moved
up and down together on their spindles, so that yarn will be wound
evenly on the bobbin.</p>

<p>Not only is a different bobbin used for spinning warp and filling
yarns, but they are also wound differently on the bobbin. Warp yarn is
wound evenly up and down the whole length of the bobbin, while the
filling bobbins, which go straight from the spindle into the shuttle of
the loom, are wound on in sections to facilitate rapid unwinding.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Twisting</em></div>

<p>We have now proceeded as far as the finished yarn. Sometimes, however,
when a particularly strong thread is desired, or in case of fancy
designs, it is desirable to twist two or more threads of yarn together,
this being known as two-ply, three-ply, etc. Various effects are obtained
by twisting different yarns together, and sometimes worsted and cotton
strands are twisted together. The operation is done on a frame similar to
the spinning frame.</p>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Weaving Gray Goods</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Principle
of Weaving</em></div>

<p>The modern power loom represents one of the most remarkable
achievements of industrial development. Into its perfection have gone
the inventions and improvements of centuries, and volumes could, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
have been written on the subject of modern weaving. Nevertheless, the
old-fashioned hand-loom has not yet gone out of existence, and still
finds its use in the development of new designs.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image032" style="max-width: 62.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image032.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Spooling</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Weaving is, of course, the process whereby yarn is made into cloth,
and its fundamental principle is that of the warp and weft structure. In
its simplest form this means that a series of threads are stretched parallel
to each other, thereby forming a warp. A second thread, called the
weft, is then passed over the odd and under the even warp threads, and
back again under the odd and over the even. In this way a cloth fabric
will gradually be built up. In most cases the process has become considerably
more complicated than this, but there are even now certain materials,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
such as calico, which retain the elementary weave. The actual
weaving, that is, the passing of the shuttle carrying the weft thread over
and under the warp threads, has now been reduced to an entirely automatic
process, even with the most complicated designs, but the preparatory
work still entails a large proportion of hand labor.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image033" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image033.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>The Creels</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Spooling</em></div>

<p>The first operation consists of winding the yarn from the bobbin on
to spools, each containing the same length of yarn. This must be done
with care or considerable waste will result.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Creel</em></div>

<p>The next step is to place these spools in a rack or creel where they
fit on glass bearings so that they may be arranged in the proper order
and run through the warper on to the section beam. The latter is a large
roller several of which are combined to form a beam. The beam is the
name given to the roller which is placed in the loom to deliver the warp
threads.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sizing</em></div>

<p>In order both to strengthen the warp threads and to make them
smoother for weaving it is usual to apply some starchy or glutinous
substance to them. This operation, which is performed in a machine
called the Slasher, is termed yarn sizing, and consists of running the
threads through a bath of preparation and then drying them quickly on
a large steam-filled drum or can. One slasher will do enough work for
200 to 500 looms.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>The Slasher</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Healding</em></div>

<p>Since it is necessary that the warp threads may be lowered or raised
in various combinations to allow the passage of the shuttle, each warp
thread must be passed through an eye in the centre of a harness wire.
Where, for instance, the warp is to be raised and depressed in three even
sections there will be three harness frames, each fitted with enough
heald-wires to accommodate one-third of the number of threads in the
entire warp. In the Jacquard loom, used for intricate patterns, each
warp-thread is separately controlled. The passing of the ends of the
warp through their proper harness wires is a delicate and skilfull operation
known as healding, or drawing-in. At the same time that this is done
the threads are passed through individual stop-motion wires, relaxed
tension on any one of which will bring the loom to a stop.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Reeding</em></div>

<p>Closely connected with drawing-in, is the final step in the preparation
of the warp, and this is called reeding or sleying. In order to keep
the warp threads in proper position during weaving they are passed
through the wires of what looks like a comb with a strip across the open
ends. This, the sley or reed, is attached to the batten on the loom and
serves in addition to drive home each weft thread after the shuttle has
passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Warp
Tieing</em></div>

<p>When the loom has devoured all the warp threads contained on one
beam, all that is necessary, if the pattern is to be continued, is to tie the
ends of the old warp to the ends of the new, and this is accomplished
with marvelous accuracy by a little machine built on the same principle
as the Barber Knotter. This avoids drawing-in a second time.</p>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Power
Loom</em></div>

<p>When the preparatory processes have been completed the actual
weaving is done, practically without human agency. The shuttle flies
back and forth at the rate of from one to two hundred picks per minute,
and when its thread is exhausted it drops out and, in the automatic
loom, is immediately supplanted by a fresh one. The harness frames
jerk up and down, forming and reforming the V shaped shed through
which the shuttle passes; and after each pick the batten drives home
the new thread into the ever-growing stretch of cloth. Like the film in a
kodak, where a roller at one end gives out plain paper which is rolled
up at the other end as a magic sheet of pictures, so in the loom the
homely warp threads are rolled out at one end, while the roller at the
other extreme winds up smooth gray cloth.</p>

<p>We have now made yarn out of cotton, and unbleached cotton cloth,
or gray goods, out of our yarn. All that remains before the fabric goes
to the finisher is an inspection for imperfections and their removal
where possible, usually by hand.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Converting and Finishing</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Old-Fashioned
Bleaching</em></div>

<p>Cotton cloth as it comes from the loom has a gray or yellowish appearance
due to the impurities it contains. The old-fashioned method of
removing these consists in simply spreading the cloth in the sun for a
few days until it is bleached white. Most cloth mills dispose of their
goods in the gray and allow the finishing to be done by a separate establishment,
although the large manufacturers of “fancies” sometimes do
their own finishing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sewing
Together</em></div>

<p>The first step in the finishing plant is to inspect the cloth and then to
sew the ends of many pieces together into long strips. This greatly
facilitates subsequent operations, because the cloth can now be run
through various processes as a single unit.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Brushing</em></div>

<p>In order to obtain a smooth surface for later processes, the cloth is
first run through a machine which brushes up the fibres and loose ends,
much as a carpet-sweeper picks up the fibres of a carpet. Sometimes a
bladed roller like a lawn-mower is used.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Singeing</em></div>

<p>Removing the raised lint is a dangerous operation because it might
easily damage the cloth, and this is usually done by the process of
singeing. The cloth is run rapidly through gas flames or over hot plates
and is quickly cooled. In this way the fuzz is burned off without injuring
the cloth.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Napping</em></div>

<p>The next step is usually the bleaching process, except where the cloth
is to be finished as a corduroy, velvet, or flannel. In the latter case it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>first run through the napper, a machine which brushes up the fibre with
wire teeth in such a way as to leave a raised face or nap.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Bleaching
Process</em></div>

<p>Bleaching is accomplished by boiling the cloth for several hours in
large iron tanks known as kiers, which contain a solution of caustic
soda. Next it is washed and scoured in dilute acid for several hours with
the object of removing iron stains. Then it is again washed, boiled a
second time, washed, run through a chemical solution of bleaching
powder, and allowed to steep. After a last washing the cloth is dried by
running over copper drums filled with steam, and is then rolled up in
bundles about the size of a barrel.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>White Goods</em></div>

<p>If the cloth is to be finished as plain white goods it is next starched
and ironed (calendared), inspected, and put up in bolts for shipment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mercerization</em></div>

<p>If, however, it is desired either to dye or print the cloth with various
colors and designs, it still has several treatments to pass through. White
goods are sometimes mercerized, but more commonly this process is
employed with cloth that is to be dyed. Mercerization is the treating of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
cotton yarn or cloth to the action of caustic soda dissolved in water, the
remaining soda being removed by a wash of dilute sulphuric acid. The
result is an increased strength of fibre, loss of elasticity, silky appearance,
and an affinity for certain dyes and mordants.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Dyeing</em></div>

<p>The subject of dyeing is one of intense interest and wide scope, but it
is unfortunately beyond the field of this brief survey. Suffice it to say
that various chemical processes and mechanical devices are employed
to give a permanent color to the cloth. (Yarn and raw stock dyeing are
less commonly employed in the cotton than in the woolen and worsted
industries.)</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Resist and
Discharge
Printing</em></div>

<p>Some cotton cloth is simply dyed with a solid color and finished, but
frequently it is first dyed with one color and then printed with others, or
with a chemical which will discharge the dye and leave white figures
wherever it touches the cloth. In contrast to this discharge method,
where it is desired to obtain white figures on a colored back-ground, it
is also possible first to print the figures with a chemical that will resist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
the subsequent action of the dye-stuff. Where a white ground is used and
it is not essential that the colors and design appear on both sides of the
cloth it is not necessary to dye at all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Printing

<p>The printing process is a very old one, and was employed centuries
ago in China and India, where natives used to impregnate cloth with
colored designs by pounding small wooden blocks carved and filled
with color on its surface. The modern printing machine has a series of
copper rollers in which the design to be printed is etched or sunk. Under
each roller where it is fixed in the printing press is a trough filled with
the particular coloring matter which that roller is to print on the cloth.
As the mechanism revolves the roller is constantly supplied with new
color, which is scraped off its surface except where the sunken design
holds it, by a knife, called the doctor. If the design calls for six colors
there will be six rollers at work, and so on up to fourteen colors at a
single run through the press.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Engraving</em></div>

<p>An infinite number of designs are printed, and the method of getting
them etched on the copper roller is a fascinating one. A zinc plate is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
carved by hand on a greatly enlarged scale from the original sketch,
and from this plate the girls who operate the pantograph machines
transfer the outlines of each color on to the copper rollers.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The
Pantograph</em></div>

<p>When the roller is placed in the pantograph it is coated with varnish.
As the girl traces the outlines of the design on her zinc plate with a
little pointer, she presses a treddle which brings a number of little diamond
points in contact with the roller. Each one of these points cuts
through the varnish, reproducing the design in its original size. There
will be as many points as the number of times the design is repeated
across the roller. When the roller is finished it is given a bath in nitric
acid which will eat into the copper where the varnish has been cut away,
thus sinking the design so that it will hold color.</p>

<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Aging and
Washing</em></div>

<p>There remain now only the finishing operations before the cloth is
ready to be packed for the market. Usually, after printing, the cloth is
steamed, or aged, to make the colors fast. Then it is fixed and soaped
thoroughly, after which it is run through the drier.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Starching</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Tenter</em></div>

<p>In order to give the cloth the proper “feel” an operation is next performed
which closely resembles warp sizing. A certain amount of hot
starch is pressed into the cloth, after which it is drawn through the
tenter frames and not only dried but stretched back to its normal width.
The tenter frame is about one hundred feet long and contains long lines
of steam pipes. On each side an endless chain with clips grips the cloth
and moving gradually further apart, these chains stretch the cloth, delivering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
it dry and of even width. (Some goods, notably those made for
Asiatic consumption in England, are not only starched but filled with
China clay, which adds over 100% to their weight.)</p>

<p>As it comes off the tenter the cloth goes through steel rollers and is
pressed smooth, after which it is automatically folded and made ready
for ticketing and packing.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">The Knitting Industry</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>History</em></div>

<p>We have just seen by what processes cotton yarn becomes first gray
cloth, and then finished goods. There is of course a tremendous variety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
of woven fabric, ranging all the way from the coarsest sail cloth to the
finest organdie. And there are certain finishes such as velveteen and
corduroy which, for want of space, we have not even touched upon.
There is, however, a whole class of cotton fabric which is not woven
but knit; and since most of our hosiery and underwear are made in this
way, it behooves us to take at least a brief glance at the knitting industry.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image045" style="max-width: 62.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image045.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Transferring Design to Copper Roller</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The principle of knitting is so familiar to every one who is or has a
mother or wife that no description of it is necessary. Curiously enough,
although the original stocking frame was invented as far back as 1589,
power was applied to the industry for the first time at Cohoes, N. Y., in
1832. This city is still the centre of underwear manufacture in this
country.</p>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image046" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image046.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Cloth in Tenter-frame</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Two Types
of
Machines</em></div>

<p>Knitting is now done on two general types of machines: the flat bed
knitter, and the circular knitting machine. In the former the garment is
knit in one flat piece and seamed afterwards. Underwear made in this
way is described as full-fashioned. On the circular machine a seam is
not necessary, for the complete cylinder of fabric is made at once.
While it is possible to manufacture underwear on a circular frame, its
use is far better adapted to the knitting of hosiery, and a very large
industry for the manufacture of this product has grown up in and near
Philadelphia.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Flat
Bed Knitter</em></div>

<p>The Cotton Knitting Frame, invented in 1864, is still the basis of the
modern flat-bed knitter. The product is a flat web which can be widened
or narrowed by transferring the loops from the edge needles to a separate
instrument, and then replacing them. In knitting stockings, the
shaped legs are made on one machine, then transferred to a heeler, and
then to a third machine which knits the feet. The stockings then must be
seamed up the back. The largest machines are capable of knitting
twenty-four garments at one time. The advantage of this type is that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
produces more elastic fabric, but it requires more operatives and more
highly skilled labor than the circular machine.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image047" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image047.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Calendar</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The
Circular
Machine</em></div>

<p>A series of inventions made in Philadelphia from 1867 to 1889 perfected
the completely automatic circular machine of which there are
now more than seven times as many in use in this country than there are
full-fashioned knitters. The seamless machine goes on continuously and
manufactures the entire garment at once. Narrowing is done by shortening
the loops, and this accounts for the loss of elasticity.</p>

<p>The finishing operations consist of seaming, where necessary, and removing
imperfections.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Growth</em></div>

<p>The growth and importance of the industry is perhaps best realized
from the fact that in 1870 there were 5,625 machines in the country, in
1905, 88,374, and now well over one hundred thousand. In 1850 men
wore hand-knitted socks and flannel underwear. From 1860 to 1910 the
product of the country’s knitting machines rose from $7,300,000 to
$200,100,000.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>Cotton yarn is used more than woolen because it spins more cheaply
and is less difficult to knit.</p>


<h3>6. <span class="smcap">Other Cotton Products</span></h3>

<p>Before concluding this part of our survey which deals with the manufacture
of cotton into finished goods, we must at least enumerate some
of the by-products and minor fruits of the industry.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Seed Oil</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Linters</em></div>

<p>To begin with, at the time that the cotton is ginned the seeds are sold
to the manufacturers of cotton oil. Without going into detail as to the
process, we have here an annual product for this country worth $384,000,000.
Seed mills regin the seed before they crush it and remove the
short fibres which have hitherto adhered to the seed. This regained cotton
is known as linters and amounts annually to about 800,000 bales.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Felt and
Surgical
Dressings</em></div>

<p>Being of very short staple this reginned cotton is adapted for the
manufacture of felts and surgical dressings, both of which are important
by-products.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Lace</em></div>

<p>The manufacture of small-wares and lace curtains is another minor
branch of cotton manufacture. Here, however, domestic production is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
comparatively small, and the bulk of the lace used is imported. Nevertheless
probably over 75,000,000 yards<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of the lace are made annually
in this country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Gun Cotton</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Collodion</em></div>

<p>Gun-cotton, a highly explosive substance, is obtained by soaking cotton
(usually linters) in nitric and sulphuric acids and then leaving it to
dry. And again, gun-cotton dissolved in ether and alcohol yields the
much used surgical adhesive known as collodion.</p>

<p>The stems and leaves of the cotton plant are used for fodder, the seed
hulls for fertilizer, and there is in fact no part of the plant from which
man has not learned to derive some useful product.</p>

FROM MILL TO CONSUMER</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Industrial Organization</span></h3>

<p>Before we proceed to discuss the various ways in which cotton goods
are marketed we shall first take a cursory glance at the way in which
the industry is subdivided.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Mill
Treasurer</em></div>

<p>The president of a cotton mill is usually not the active head of the
business; his position corresponds to that of the chairman of the board
of directors in the usual banking or mercantile corporation. The mill
treasurer is, on the other hand, the chief directive force, and he performs
the two all-important functions of buying the mill’s raw cotton
and selling its product, either direct or through other channels. In the
mills of New Bedford and Fall River, which make chiefly gray goods,
the treasurer usually has his office at the mill. In most other New England
mills the treasurer is usually a member of a selling house and is
frequently the treasurer for more than one mill.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Agent
or Supt.</em></div>

<p>Where the treasurer has his office in the mill the man who has charge
of the actual operation is known as the mill superintendent. His functions
include the general management of the plant and the purchasing of
supplies other than cotton. Where the treasurer maintains his office in a
selling house, the operating head is known as an Agent and enjoys a
greater degree of responsibility and independence. There are of course
a varying number of minor operating chiefs in charge of sundry departments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Spinning
and Weaving
in Same
Plant</em></div>

<p>The average New England cotton mill contains about fifty thousand
spindles, while the Southern mill runs about twenty-five thousand. The
vast majority of mills do both spinning and weaving, although some
Southern mills sell yarn and some Pennsylvania establishments do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
nothing but weave. Of the entire number of spindles in the country,
83%, and of the looms 97%, are in mills which do both spinning and
weaving.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Segregation
of the
Converter</em></div>

<p>In contrast to the tendency towards unification in spinning and weaving
is the ever-increasing segregation of the converting plants. The rise
of the merchant-converter, the growing demand for a great variety of
finishes, and the fact that converting is very much cheaper on a large
scale, have all brought about an increasing tendency on the part of the
mill to sell its cloth in the gray, or to have it finished on commission.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Knitting</em></div>

<p>While a few large knitting mills spin their own yarn, this is the exception
rather than the rule. On the other hand the knitting mills finish
their product for the market themselves, and sell either direct or through
a selling house.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Distribution of Products</span></h3>

<p>There are four general ways in which a cotton mill may dispose of
its products: a. by selling direct, b. through a selling house, c. through
a broker, d. through a converter.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><p class="center no-indent"><em>a.</em><br>

<em>Selling
Direct</em></p></div>

<p>A few very large mills maintain selling offices of their own in the
large centers of distribution through which they market their goods direct
to the jobbers and retailers. In most cases where direct selling is
done, however, the goods are sold in the gray by the mill treasurer at
the mill. This practice is common with those mills which make staple
gray goods and which, when not sold ahead, are able to manufacture
for stock against spot sales. A few Southern yarn mills also sell direct.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><p class="center no-indent"><em>b.</em><br>

<em>Growth of
the Selling
House</em></p></div>

<p>The relation between the manufacturer and commercial banker or
commission house is as old as the industry itself. Slater’s first mill in
1790 was financed by Almy &amp; Brown of Boston, who undertook to market
his goods and also to furnish him the credit he needed to buy cotton
and supplies. In the early days the cloth was sold at auction by the
selling house and the proceeds less commission credited to the mill.
Later on the factors developed extensive selling organizations throughout
the country by means of which they were able to market the products
of a good many mills.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">“<em>Fancies</em>”</div>

<p>The distribution of fancy goods requires a great deal of skill. The
Fall and Spring lines to be manufactured by the mills are sent out to
the trade by the selling house about six months ahead, and orders are
taken before manufacture begins so as to be sure that the line will
“take”. Of course there is always the danger of cancellations even then,
for which the selling house must bear most of the responsibility.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Finances</em></div>

<p>In addition to distributing the goods and guaranteeing the accounts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
the commission house renders financial assistance either by advancing
on the mill’s product, or by indorsing its notes. In return it receives
the sole agency for the mill’s products, interest on the money advanced
and a commission. The latter varies with the amount of financial assistance
required by the mill and the desirability of the risk.</p>

<p>As a general rule the Southern mills, because of their distance from
the chief markets in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, are more
dependent upon their selling agents than the New England manufacturers.</p>

<p>In New England a great number of manufacturers are amply able to
finance themselves, and could if necessary sell their own products.
Stock ownership, however, and old ties have frequently kept up the relationship
with the selling houses after its usefulness was partly outworn.
Nevertheless in the selling of fancy goods, even where the mill is
supplied with plenty of capital, the commission house fulfills a very
necessary function.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p class="center no-indent"><em>c.</em><br>

<em>The Broker</em></p></div>

<p>Gray goods are very often sold either by a mill or a selling house
through the medium of a cloth broker. The latter is strictly a middle
man in that he does nothing but bring together prospective purchaser
and seller. In the event of sale he gets a commission of ½%, which he
often more than earns by his efforts. These brokers are in touch with all
the mills, converters, and consumers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><p class="center no-indent"><em>d.</em><br>

<em>Merchant
Converters</em></p></div>

<p>While there are some independent finishing establishments, most of
them operate on a commission basis for merchant converters. The latter
are a class of merchants of comparatively recent origin, having appeared
first about 1880, since which time they have practically taken
control of the finishing industry. They buy gray goods either direct
from the mill, or through a broker or selling house, and have them finished
according to whatever they think the requirements of the market
are. Inasmuch as they pay on short credit and carry the goods during
conversion, frequently selling on several months’ credit to jobbers and
retailers, they perform an important part of the financing of the cloth.
Their recent rapid rise has been due largely to the growing demand for
a multiplicity of seasonal designs.</p>

<p>Some large cutters-up, and a few big mail-order houses do their own
finishing or have it done. As a rule they buy from converters and sell to
the jobber, retailer, or consumer.</p>

<p>We have now traced the cotton from the seed through the various
processes of manufacture and finishing, and followed the finished goods
through the channels of distribution to the consumer. It remains only
for us to compare briefly the position of the United States with that of
other countries, and the position of the various sections within the
United States.</p>

THE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Cotton Production and Consumption</span></h3>

<p>Ever since the Civil War the United States has produced more than
half of the world’s cotton crop. From 1860 to 1900 about one-third of
the annual crop was consumed by the domestic industries, and from that
time domestic takings have increased, except for 1921, to an average of
about 50% in the last few years. During the same period the actual size
of the annual crops increased enormously. If we take the figures from
the present back to 1790 it will give a rough idea of the progress since
that time.</p>

THE RAW MATERIAL</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Sheep Raising</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Early History</em></div>

<p>The raising of sheep goes so far back into primitive times that historians
have been compelled to draw a veil over its origin. Whether sheep
antedate man, or man existed before sheep, is a question that has never
been authoritatively answered. For our purposes very little history will
suffice. We know that sheep were raised in Biblical times, but we do not
know much about them. We do know, however, that the old Romans
practised sheep-breeding with great care and even went so far as to
cover their animals with cloth in order to preserve the clean quality of
the fleece. During the reign of the Roman Emperor, Claudius (A. D.,
50), an Italian named Columella, took several Italian sheep to Spain
and crossed them with the native Spanish Merino breed. It is said that
the resulting type is the progenitor of all the Merino breeds which now
form the basis of sheep-breeding. Under the rule of the Saracens, Spain
became not only a great sheep-raising country, but a woolen manufacturing
country as well. In the thirteenth century there were no less than
sixteen thousand looms in the town of Seville alone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Spain</em></div>

<p>When the Saracens were driven out by Philip III. the textile industry
disappeared from Spain, but sheep husbandry, which did not require
skilled labor, remained, and Spanish wool continued to be the finest in
the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Europe</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Spread of
Merino</em></div>

<p>During the eighteenth century various European countries began to
import merinos and cross them with their native breeds. This, because
of the sturdy quality of some of the native types, frequently produced
excellent results. In France we thus have the origin of the Rambouillet
merino, in Germany and Austria of the Saxony and Silesian breeds. In
1810 merinos were first introduced into Australia with astonishing results
both as to grade of wool and increase of flocks. About the same
time South America, South Africa, and the United States imported Spanish
sheep. Of all the highly civilized countries, England is the only one
where merino breeding was not successful. This was due in part to the
climate, but the chief cause was the fact that British sheep-raising was
primarily for mutton purposes, and only secondarily for wool. The
merino types are smaller, and hence do not yield as good mutton carcasses
as some of the native “Down” and “Mountain” breeds. In many
cases, however, the native English breeds, notably the Lincolns, have
been imported to other countries and there crossed with merinos with
very good success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Native
Breeds</em></div>

<p>It would not be possible to give in detail the various breeds of sheep
existing in different countries. Merino sheep are now bred in many parts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
of the world, and, together with the high crossbreds, are the source of
all the fine wools known as merino, half-blood, and three-eighths wools.
Long wools are derived from various native breeds, chiefly English, and
from the lower crossbreds of merinos, such as quarter and low quarter
bloods. Chinese, Siberian, and Turkish wools, as well as many other
uncivilized types, are usually very long and coarse, and are known as
carpet and braid wools.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Sources</em></div>

<p>Most of the best merino wools come from Australia, the next best
from South Africa, and from South America. The latter have one
fault in that they contain many spiral burrs which are difficult to remove,
and which frequently get through the machines and show up as
imperfections in the cloth. Europe grows some very fine short wools,
but these hardly ever leave the countries they are grown in.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>U. S.
Domestic</em></div>

<p>United States wools are known as “domestic” and “territory.” Domestic
wools are those grown in the eastern and middle western states, notably
in the Ohio valley. These contain the highest grades of merino
wools grown in this country. It must be remembered that sheep raising
began in the East, and as civilization expanded, was gradually crowded
further and further westward. The opening of the Erie Canal in 1825
made available the fertile pasture lands of the Ohio valley. The Ohio
Canal eight years later opened up still more territory, and in 1849 during
the famous gold rush, sheep were first taken to California.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Territory</em></div>

<p>The territory wools are those grown in the Rocky Mountain Plateau
states. Recently, with improved methods and greater care in breeding,
some very fine wools have been derived from Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada,
and Montana, and from a few other states. The Texas and California
wools are usually classed separately, because they are in most cases
clipped twice a year. A little later we shall discuss the various grades
and sorts of wool obtained from the different breeds, but as the wool is
shorn or pulled before it is graded, we shall take up these processes first.</p>

<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Shearing and Marketing of Fleece Wool</span></h3>

<p>Wool is obtained from the sheep in two ways; it is either shorn from
the live animal, or pulled from the skin of the slaughtered carcass.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Shearing</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Australian
System</em></div>

<p>Shearing was formerly done by hand. An expert was able to clip as
many as one hundred head per day, but the average was less than half
of that amount. The introduction of machine shearing has made it possible
for one man to shear from 175 to 200 sheep in a day, and the fleece
is very much more evenly clipped than formerly. Some merino breeds,
known as type A, have so many folds of loose skin that machine shearing
is not feasible, but except for these animals, and some of the type B
or Rambouillet Merinos, almost all sheep are now shorn by machine,
that is, where they are raised in numbers. Sheep raising in this country
is not pursued with nearly so much care as, for instance, in Australia.
There they have huge shearing sheds where the animals are first sweated
and then carefully shorn. Whereas here the entire fleece is left in one
piece, in Australia the belly is shorn separately and each fleece is carefully
skirted, that is, the inferior parts such as the britch are torn off.
Then each fleece is folded and tied up and the fleeces are put up in bales.
Moreover, a bale usually contains fleeces of the same grade, so that
practically nothing but sorting remains to be done by the purchaser.
Here, on the other hand, fleeces are shorn in one piece and are folded
up carelessly, without skirting. The tying up is frequently done in a
slovenly manner, and a bag will very often contain all grades of wool
from the finest to the coarsest. Of late years some attempt has been
made to install the Australian system, but without much success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Seasons</em></div>

<p>The shearing season in the northern hemisphere is in the spring, in
countries below the equator, except Australia, it is, of course, in our
fall. In Texas and California, as well as in some other localities, shearing
is frequently done twice a year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Marketing</em></div>

<p>Roughly speaking, there are seven ways in which the wool grower
may dispose of his fleece wool:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Merchant
Buyers</em></div>

<p>1. He may sell it to buyers representing merchants. The merchant,
while he is a middle man and therefore incurs the usual anathema, performs
a variety of very essential services. At the time of the clip he sends
his buyers to the wool producing centers and buys the clip for cash, then
he ships it to his warehouse, grades it, and sells to the mills on credit.
Obviously he finances a very important part of the production, and is
furthermore essential, because he knows the demand, which the wool-grower
does not, and the supply—of which the mill is usually ignorant.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mill
Buyers</em></div>

<p>2. The wool grower may also sell to buyers representing mills. He
likes to do this because he eliminates the merchant’s profit, but, as a
matter of fact, there are only very few mills large enough to stand the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
buying expense, and even fewer that can afford to buy their whole season’s
supply of raw material at one time and for cash. Also, mills can
usually employ only certain grades of wool, and cannot therefore as a
rule buy a whole clip.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Consignment</em></div>

<p>3. If the grower thinks that he is not receiving fair offers from the
visiting buyers, he will frequently consign his wool to a merchant to be
sold on commission for his account. In this case he may or may not get
a better price, but it costs him his carrying charges plus commission.
There are some wool houses that make it a specialty to execute commission
sales of this nature.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Local Mills</em></div>

<p>4. Some wool is sold direct to nearby mills. This is done particularly
in Ohio, where many of the smaller mills obtain their entire requirements
in this manner.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Local
Dealers</em></div>

<p>5. Wool growers sometimes sell to local dealers. This is particularly
prevalent in regions where the individual grower’s production is small.
In most eastern states there are a great number of small farmers who
grow a certain amount of wool. The local dealers are in many cases also
the general store-keepers, and, since they are the farmer’s creditor on
other merchandise, and since the average farmer knows very little about
the grades of wool, these individuals very frequently turn a handsome
profit when they in turn sell to the visiting buyers.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Coop. Sales</em></div>

<p>6. Some wool is sold through farmers’ co-operative sales agencies,
but these organizations have in the past been so poorly administered,
that, as a general rule they have not been successful. The movement is,
however, gaining ground and has shown great progress during recent
years.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Auctions</em></div>

<p>7. Finally, there remains the method whereby almost all the British
and colonial wools are sold, namely, by auction. Auction sales have
been established for almost a century in London, Liverpool, Antwerp,
Bremen, Hamburg, Marseilles, and recently in Australia. This method
of disposing of their raw product does not, however, appeal to the
American growers, because of the inherent American trading instinct. It
is also not very feasible in this country, because the wool is not graded
in the shearing sheds and because sheep-raising in not standardized.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Markets</em></div>

<p>The chief markets for wool in this country are Boston, Philadelphia,
Chicago, New York and St. Louis.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Pulled Wool</span></h3>

<p>We have above discussed the shearing and marketing of wool obtained
from the living animal. There remains a large quantity of wool
which is taken from the pelts of slaughtered sheep. In 1919 there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
produced 48,300,000 pounds of pulled wool in the U. S. as against
265,939,000 pounds of sheared wool.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Use</em></div>

<p>Skin wool, or tanner’s wool, as it is sometimes known, is used extensively
for soft twist yarns, bed blankets, flannels, felts, etc. It is also
used as an admixture in blends for top-making, as we shall see later.</p>

<p>There are three methods whereby pulled wool is obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sweating</em></div>

<p>The oldest and simplest process is known as sweating, and consists
simply in sweating the hides until the wool is loosened and can easily be
pulled out. The disadvantage of this method is that it injures the hides.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Lime</em></div>

<p>The lime process consists in loosening the wool by painting the flesh
side of the hide with lime. This also injures the hides somewhat and has
a bad effect on the dyeing qualities of the wool.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Depilatory</em></div>

<p>The depilatory process is the best, and varies from the lime process
only in that a solution is used instead of lime. This mixture consists of
sodium sulphate, sulphuric acid, and oyster shells.</p>

<p>By far the greatest pullery in the world is situated at Mazamet,
France, where the industry has assumed gigantic proportions. The large
packers in this country all operate their own pulleries, and the pulled
wool is marketed largely by them. Most mills buy their pulled wool
direct from the pulleries, but some is handled by merchants.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">What is Wool</span></h3>

<p>We have now traced the wool from the sheep’s back as far as the bag,
and may assume that the bag has travelled from the shearing shed to
the merchant’s or mill’s warehouse. Some foreign wools, notably Australian
and South American, are, as we have seen, skirted and roughly
graded in the shearing shed, so that, when the bag is opened, there remains
only the sorting to do. Grading is the separation of fleeces into
classified groups. Skirting is the removal from each fleece of the worst
parts, namely, the britch wool, manure locks (known as tags), and
matted or kempy portions. Sorting is the dividing of the individual
fleece into various classifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Wool as
Against Hair</em></div>

<p>Before we take up the grades and sorts in detail, it will be well for us
to inquire briefly into the nature of the wool fibre. In the first place,
wool differs from hair in that its fibre consists of a core (medulla), a
pulp (cortex), and an epidermis. A hair follicle consists of a medulla
and an epidermis. Moreover, the epidermis of a hair is closely and evenly
scaled, which makes it smooth and lustrous. The surface of a wool
fibre is not evenly serrated, which accounts for the felting, or interlocking,
quality. Wool in which there is insufficient moisture and natural
grease (yolk) frequently becomes felted at the ends. Such wool is variously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
referred to as cotted, cotty, or brashy. The tensile strength of a
wool fibre is low, its elasticity high. The length of the fibre varies from
one to over ten inches, and the diameter from .0018 to .004 inches. The
better a wool the less like it is to a hair. Generally speaking, the finer
the wool, the shorter the fibre, but length alone would not indicate the
grade. Pure merino and high cross-bred wools have a close wave, known
as crimp, which increases the elasticity and is therefore desirable from
a spinning standpoint.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of wool is: carbon 50%, hydrogen 7%,
nitrogen 18%, oxygen 22%, and sulphur 3%. It is soluble in alkalies,
and at a temperature of 130° C. will reduce to powder.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Shrinkage</em></div>

<p>Wool before it is scoured contains a large quantity of yolk, or natural
grease, and also, besides dust and vegetable matter, a considerable
amount of dried perspiration, or suint. The amount of weight lost
through the removal of these substances when the wool is scoured is
termed shrinkage. It will be readily appreciated that this is a very important
factor in connection with the purchase of grease wool. The percentage
of shrinkage varies from 20% to 80%. Nevertheless a good
buyer will often be able to estimate within one or two per cent. The
factors to be considered in this connection are the breed, the soil, the
climate, and the care with which the sheep are raised, as well as the diligence
with which the fleeces are put up. Fine wools always shrink more
heavily than coarse; and pulled wools, since they are washed and
brushed during the process, show a very much lower shrinkage than
fleece wools. The average shrinkage of United States wools is about
55%. Fine domestics shrink about 60%. Lower grades about 45%. Fine
territory wools about 65%; lower grades about 55%. Pulled wool averages
about 27%. Fine Australian wools average 49%, for, although
they are the finest, the fleeces contain less dirt. Cape wools about 62%,
and South American about 51%.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Qualities
Desired</em></div>

<p>The qualities looked for in wool are roughly six, and they vary according
to the purpose for which the wool is to be used.</p>

<p>1. It must be fine enough to spin the required number of counts.</p>

<p>2. It must be strong enough to withstand strain of manufacture.</p>

<p>3. It must have the proper staple (length).</p>

<p>4. It must be of a certain softness or hardness.</p>

<p>5. It must have the proper felting qualities if the material is to be
fulled.</p>

<p>6. It must either scour white, or else have sufficient lustre to take
dyes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Clothing
and
Combing</em></div>

<p>As we take up the manufacture of worsted and woolen yarns we shall
see how these qualifications play a different part in the two processes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
At the outset the only important difference we are concerned with is
staple length. Generally speaking, wools under two inches are too short
to be combed and are classed as clothing wools. <em>Clothing wools are used
for woolens, combing wools for worsteds.</em> This applies only to wools of
fine fibre. The mere fact that a wool has long staple length does not
make it a combing wool. As a rule, the coarser the wool the longer its
staple, and the longest wools are the exceedingly coarse “common” or
“braid” wools, which can only be used for carpet manufacture.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/image065.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Sorting Wool</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>In grading and sorting, practically the only guide is the fineness of
the individual fibre. The other qualifications just enumerated have a
very important bearing on what the wool can be used for, but they have
very little to do with its classification by grades.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Classifications</em></div>

<p>Fleece wools are graded by two systems, one by bloods, the other by
counts spun. (This means the number of hanks of 560 yards each to a
pound of yarn.) Domestic and foreign wools are usually graded by
bloods. U. S. Territory wools are graded a little differently, as per second
column below, and pulled wool is only roughly graded into four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
classes (third column). The blood classifications originated from the
breeding of the sheep, but, as a matter of fact they have become arbitrary
terms denoting a certain degree of fineness. The same fleece may,
and frequently does, contain ½, ⅜, and ¼ blood wool.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Sorting</em></div>

<p>When a bag of domestic wool is opened the fleeces are taken out one
by one and put into baskets according to the grades in the first column.
The grader simply decides what the majority of the fleece is and puts it
into that class. When he has filled a basket with, let us say, half-blood
fleeces, this basket is given to a sorter. He takes each fleece, shakes it out,
and, first of all, skirts it. Then he separates it into the various sorts it
contains. Fleeces graded as half-blood will probably sort into mostly
half, some fine (full-blood), and a considerable quantity of three-eighths
blood. The best wool comes off the shoulders, then the sides,
then the back, then the thighs, and finally the britch and belly. Usually
a fleece will not contain more than three sorts.</p>

<p>If this were a bag of Australian, South American, or Cape wool, the
fleeces would in all probability have been bagged according to grades,
so that only the sorting operation would have to be performed by the
merchant or the mill.</p>

<p>When the wool has been sorted it is put into bins, and may now be
said to be ready for the first of the manufacturing processes for which it
is destined. Sorting is sometimes done by the merchants, but more frequently
by the manufacturers.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Off-sorts</em></div>

<p>Kempy or cotted pieces, tags, stained or painty wool, etc., are called
off-sorts, and these are put through a number of processes for the purpose
of reclaiming as much of the wool as possible.</p>

WORSTED MANUFACTURE</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Scouring</span></h3>

<p>When the wool has been graded it is sold either to worsted manufacturers
or to makers of woolen goods. The two industries are entirely
distinct and separate.</p>

<p>The first cog in the worsted machine is the wool comber, or top-maker.
Sometimes he buys assorted grades, known as matchings, from a
wool merchant; sometimes he buys and sorts his own wool; but most
frequently he sorts and combs the wool on a commission basis. Many of
the big worsted mills do their own sorting and combing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Blending</em></div>

<p>Tops are usually made from blends of various kinds of wool, and
this blending is done after sorting, before the wool is scoured.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Scouring</em></div>

<p>Scouring is nothing more or less than a glorified washing. A machine
closely akin to a gigantic laundry machine removes first the yolk or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
grease in an alkaline solution, and then rinses out the dirt and suint in
a series of soap and water baths. The last bath is pure water, and from
this the wool is taken on a belt through the drier. From the drier it is
usually blown through tubes to the carding room.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Worsted carding Machine</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Approximately 20% of the moisture is allowed to remain in the wool
in order to facilitate subsequent processes. If the wool is still warm it is
easier to card.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Carding</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Opens
Fibres</em></div>

<p>The purpose of the carding operation is to open out the fibres in the
wool. Originally, carding was done by hand with two leather surfaces,
much like butter pats, the inner faces of which were studded with wire
nails. Between these two surfaces the wool was rubbed until all the
fibres were opened out. In woolen manufacture carding is more violent
and seeks to lay the fibres in all directions. Worsted carding aims to
separate the fibres, but also to keep them as closely parallel as possible.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Card</em></div>

<p>The carding machine is somewhat similar to that used for cotton (see
page <a href="#Page_22">22</a>). The wool is automatically fed between the feed rollers, which
revolve in opposite directions and are armed with heavy teeth. From
the feed a roller known as the licker-in starts the wool on its course over
a number of cylinders, each of which is surrounded by several toothed
rollers known as workers. Each worker has a smaller companion roller,
revolving at a higher speed, which derives its name of stripper from the
fact that its function is to take the wool off the worker and deliver it to
the next worker. The last roller, known as the fancy, raises the wool off
the cylinder to be caught by the doffer. The doffing-comb lifts the wool
in a filmy sheet of fibres, which is condensed into a thick untwisted rope
by passing through a funnel on to the balling-head. This rope, which is
about an inch and a half in diameter, is known as a sliver. A certain
length of it is automatically rolled into balls and these are taken into
the back-wash room. From a loose unrelated mass the wool has now
been transformed into a continuous strand of more or less uniform
diameter.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Backwashing and Gilling</span></h3>

<p>A back-wash machine takes several of the carded slivers and combines
them into one. The slivers pass through several baths which rinse
them thoroughly and are then slowly drawn through a drier. The process
is quite similar to scouring, except that it is very much less violent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Combining
and Drawing
Slivers</em></div>

<p>As the slivers come out of the drier they are fed through a number of
gill boxes. The gill box is the first of a long series of drawing operations.
In this, and all the following stages of open drawing, there are
always several slivers being combined into one and drawn out until the
resulting sliver has about the same or a smaller diameter than the ones
fed into the machine. The principle of the gill box is quite simple.
Several slivers are fed in between rollers revolving at a comparatively
low rate of speed. As they pass through they are flattened out over what
is known as a faller. This is armed with very fine close wire teeth which
come up through the fibres and the draft is imparted when the wool is
taken off the faller by a final pair of rollers which are revolving considerably
faster. The sheet of wool which emerges from these rollers is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
again passed through a funnel and thereby condensed once more into a
sliver. This operation is repeated from two to four times, according to
the quality of the top desired, and the methods employed by the particular
mill.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image072" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image072.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Gilling the top</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>Where very coarse long fibred wool is to be worked there is no carding,
and the wool is prepared by straightening the fibres into a sliver
through a series of gill-boxes.</p>

<p>At some point during the gilling process a slight amount of oil is
usually dropped onto the sliver, as this facilitates combing.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Combing</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Removes
Short
Fibres</em></div>

<p>The next operation, namely that of combing, is again simple when
viewed as the primitive manufacturing process. The old comber would
take a short length of sliver, hang it on a nail by tying one end together
and then proceed to comb out the short fibres much as one may comb
out the dead short hairs from a dog’s coat. Combing is simply the removal
from the sliver of the short fibres which would not spin properly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</span>
These short fibres are known as noils and are the waste product of top-making.
The top is a continuous untwisted strand of long wool fibres
made parallel by the comb. (By long fibres we mean fibres which are
relatively long. Some tops consist of fibres less than an inch and a half
in length. In this case, which is very infrequent, the noil would be even
shorter.)</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image073" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image073.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>The Noble Comb</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Noils</em></div>

<p>Noils are sold either to woolen or knitting mills direct by the top-maker,
or else to a merchant who disposes of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>The Noble
Comb</em></div>

<p>The Noble circular comb is the most generally used combing machine.
Other types are the Lister, the Holden, and the Heilmann. The
Noble comb is a compact circular structure standing at a height of about
three feet from the floor, with a steam box underneath it. (Heat greatly
facilitates the process.) There are two smaller circles inside the main
circumference which are tangent to the outer circle at opposite points of
its diameter. All rotate in the same direction. Seventy-two slivers are
rolled up in creels on the outside of the main circle and are automatically
fed on to the tangental points. A dabbing brush pushes the slivers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
down between the points of the two circles. As the circles draw apart
the long fibres are left protruding from the inner edge of the outer
circle and the outer edge of the inner circles. They travel thus until they
are gripped by vertical rollers set to catch them. After passing the
rollers the wool is lifted off the pins of the circles by knives. The four
ribbons of combed fibres (two from the outer and one from each of the
inner circles) are condensed into a single beautiful even band which
coils itself softly into a revolving can. What remains is the waste or noil.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Gilling the
Top</em></div>

<p>The top, as it comes from the comb, is again put through a series of
several gill boxes with the object of further drawing it out. Once again
several slivers are combined into one in each process. At the end of this
gilling the top is coiled in balls and allowed to rest.</p>

<p>We have now reduced the wool to its real worsted basis. The noils
have been taken out, and the balls of top are ready to be sent to the
spinner to be spun into worsted yarn.</p>


<h3>5. <span class="smcap">Spinning</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Drawing</em></div>

<p>The first processes in a spinning mill very closely approximate the
last operations in the combing plant. The tops are usually gilled several
times before weighing, and then are put through several drawing machines
in which, as heretofore, several slivers are condensed into one. In
the last of these machines there are no fallers, the entire process consisting
of two sets of rollers revolving at different speed. Each operation
results in a slightly finer sliver, and the number of machines through
which the material is drawn is determined by the fineness of the yarn
desired.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>French</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>English</em></div>

<p>The last of the drawing processes is the so-called roving box, which,
in most cases is a cone-drawing process. There is a difference here between
French spinning and English spinning. According to the French
system, which is employed in this country only for very soft fine yarns,
no twist is given to the sliver until the actual spinning begins; and the
spinning is then usually done on mules, which in this country are rarely
used in the manufacture of worsted yarn. We shall discuss these machines
when we come to woolens. According to the most common procedure
in this country, the roving box not only draws, but imparts a
certain amount of twist to the yarn. This is done by winding the yarn
from horizontal spools on to vertical spindles. These spindles are set on
long frames, similar to spinning frames, one frame containing about
200 spindles. The yarn is guided on the bobbin by an arm, known as the
flyer, which draws the bobbin around after it.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Spinning</em></div>

<p>There is very little difference between this last drawing operation and
the actual spinning which immediately succeeds it. In both cases the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
yarn is unwound from horizontal spools placed at the top of the frame
through the inevitable two rollers going at different speeds, and guided
on to the revolving spindle. Since the spindle revolves vertically the
yarn is twisted. The amount of twist is regulated, as is also the amount
of tension, and these two factors, together with the quality of the material,
determine the quality of the yarn. Worsted yarn is graded according
to the number of counts, which, as we have seen, is the number of
hanks of 560 yards that make a pound avoirdupois.</p>
<br>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Flyer</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Cap</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Ring</em></div>

<p>Roughly speaking, there are three modern methods of spinning,
namely, the flyer, cap, and ring frames. All of them are derived from
Arkwright’s original water throstle, and, if we want to go further back,
from the old-fashioned spinning wheel. The chief difference between the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
three types lies in the method of driving the spindle and guiding the
yarn on to the bobbin. The flyer arm we have described briefly above.
In the cap system, the bobbin is moved up and down in a fixed metal
cap, something like the front end of a two-inch shell-casing, and this
method of guiding the yarn has the advantage that, because of its lower
vibration, the spindles may be driven faster. It also causes considerably
more friction on the yarn. For worsted spinning it is probably the most
commonly employed. Ring spinning, the most frequently used for cotton,
and described briefly on page <a href="#Page_28">28</a>, is very similar (to the layman)
except that the spindle revolves in a metal sleeve, and that the yarn is
guided by a metal ring with a traveller, instead of by the end of the cap.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Reducing</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Twisting</em></div>

<p>What follows now is merely an auxiliary process of spinning. The
yarn has been completed, but it is rarely used for weaving, as it comes
off the spindle. Several strands are usually twisted together, both to
make it stronger and to give various effects of body and color. The number
of strands in a yarn are designated as plys. Yarn consisting of two
strands is called two-ply, three strands are three-ply, and so on. Yarns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span>
of two or more colors, or yarns of varying counts, are frequently twisted
together. It is possible also to twist worsted and cotton yarns.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image077" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image077.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Cap spinning</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Spindlage</em></div>

<p>Twisting is done in a manner similar to spinning. A worsted spinning
mill usually has about a third as many twisting spindles as spinning
spindles, but it is important to remember that when speaking of a mill’s
capacity in terms of spindles, it is only the spinning spindles that are
counted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Winding or
Skeining</em></div>

<p>After the twisting is completed the finished yarn is wound on small
spools, known as cheesers, to be weighed. Next it is wound on large
spools in such a way that the large spool holds the contents of from ten
to twenty cheesers, each wound in an adjacent space at the same time.
Some of the yarn is shipped to weaving mills on these large spools; and
some of it is taken off them and skeined.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Waste</em></div>

<p>We are now ready to weave the cloth, but there are a considerable
number of very interesting details which we have been forced to omit.
All the processes we have discussed produce a certain amount of waste
material. The combing waste, known as noils, is the largest by-product<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
of the worsted industry, but there is also a considerable amount of yarn
waste produced in the various drawing and spinning operations. Practically
all of this material finds its way back, in one form or another,
into the woolen industry. The subject of reclaiming waste is in itself so
comprehensive that we can do no more than touch upon it here.</p>


<h3>6. <span class="smcap">Dyeing</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Wool and
Piece and
Double
Dyeing</em></div>

<p>Some yarns are dyed after they have been spun. In most cases, however,
woolen yarns receive their color after the wool is scoured and before
it goes into the carding machine. In worsted manufacture the common
procedure is to dye the top after it has been combed. In this way a
uniform color is obtained, whereas it is exceedingly difficult to obtain
the same color from two vats in piece-dyeing. Some materials are both
wool and piece-dyed, the second dye being given to the cloth. This is
done in cases where a peculiarly fast color is desired, or where the cloth
contains separate materials such as wool and cotton.</p>

<p>The operation of the loom has already been described in connection
with the manufacture of cotton, but the preparatory processes, although
somewhat similar, vary considerably because of the difference
in the nature of the materials. In worsted manufacture the work which
has to be done before the loom can begin to operate is usually referred
to as loom-mounting, and consists of five stages.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Warping</em></div>

<p>1. Warping is the arranging of the warp threads in the order necessary
to produce the desired cloth. This was formerly, and still is to a
great extent, done entirely by hand on a sort of rack known as the woof.
In the larger mills, however, warping is now done either on a sectional
warping machine or on the warping mill. Both these devices are only
partly automatic, and require highly-skilled labor.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Sizing</em></div>

<p>2. The mechanical structure of woolen or worsted yarns necessitates
the application of some glutinous substance to their surfaces before
subjecting them to the weaving process. No matter how even the worsted
yarn, a microscopic examination would show certain fibres protruding
from the surface. Sizing has the effect of smoothing the surface of the
yarn, and at the same time distributing more evenly the strain of weaving.
The sizing machine is rather like the back-washer used in the manufacturing
of worsted yarn. The warp is run through the sizing bath and
then compressed between rollers, after which it is dried by steam or
fan.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Beaming</em></div>

<p>3. Beaming is the term applied to winding the warp upon the beam
of the loom. (The beam is the roller from which the warp threads are
unwound as the weaving progresses.) In order to keep the threads in
their proper position an instrument known as a raddle is employed, and
the raddling process is one which requires considerable care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image079" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image079.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Drawing in the warp threads</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Healding</em></div>

<p>4. The next step, healding, is the same as that described on page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>
and enables the warp threads to be lifted in sections in order that the
shuttle may pass under some and over others. From the original weave
of lifting alternate threads, a great many complicated designs have
been evolved, which necessitate the lifting of the warp threads in many
small series. In the elementary weave where there are only two groups,
this work is done by heald-wires which raise the odd and depress the
even threads, thus forming a V, known as the shed, through which the
shuttle may pass. As the design becomes more intricate the healding
process becomes more complicated, and the number of heald shafts increases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sleying</em></div>

<p>5. Sleying, or reeding, is the final preparatory process, and has the
object of keeping the warp threads the proper distance apart during
weaving. The sley is really nothing more than a fine comb with a strip
across the ends of the teeth. The warp threads are passed between the
wires (reeds) of the sley and are so compelled to keep their proper
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image080" style="max-width: 52.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image080.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Weaving</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The sley is attached to the batten, or fly, and as in the cotton loom
performs the additional function of driving home each weft thread
after the shuttle has passed.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Power
Loom</em></div>

<p>Once these processes have been completed the remainder is almost
entirely automatic. The shuttle flies back and forth without aid. The
proper warp threads are raised and lowered to let it pass, and after
each traverse, or pick, the batten automatically drives home the weft
thread, into the growing stretch of cloth that is winding itself up on to
the beam at one end, while the beam at the other end delivers the parallel
warp threads. The average worsted loom makes about 100 picks per
minute, which is only about half as fast as the calico loom, the reason
being the lower tensile strength of the yarn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span></p>


<h3>8. <span class="smcap">Worsted Finishing</span></h3>

<p>While, as we shall see, finishing in the woolen industry is a very important
stage of manufacture, worsted materials are practically unchanged
after they come out of the loom. There is sometimes a certain
amount of fulling and raising and cropping, but the net result does not
in any way alter the cloth, except perhaps to impart a little smoother
finish. We shall discuss finishing in a little more detail when we come to
the last stage of woolen manufacture.</p>

<p>Our worsted cloth is now finished, and we have traced its origin,
somewhat sketchily, from the back of the sheep up to the point where it
takes only a tailor to put it on the back of a man.</p>

WOOLEN MANUFACTURE</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">The Manufacture of Woolen Yarn</span></h3>

<p>We have taken the worsted industry first, not because it is necessarily
any more important than woolen manufacture, but because its processes
are more complicated, and therefor, if we have gained a certain amount
of familiarity with them, we are able to take up the sister industry in a
more abbreviated manner. Although, at the present time, the demand for
worsted materials is a great deal heavier than the demand for woolens,
the woolen industry is by far the older of the two, and may rightfully
claim that the worsted branch is really an off-shoot of its tree. Moreover,
while broadcloth and similar material no longer enjoy their erstwhile
popularity, there is still a tremendous demand for other products of the
woolen industry such as blankets, flannels, overcoatings, etc. And we
must bear in mind that most of the cheaper clothing materials are
woolens.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Raw Material</em></div>

<p>In the sorting of wool we saw that the shorter staples were classed as
clothing wools. To these must be added the noils from worsted combing,
yarn waste, and wool reclaimed from off-sorts, as well as wool extract
made from rags, before we have the raw material for the woolen industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Scouring</em></div>

<p>Whereas we found that combing wool had to be left in the grease until
it could be carded immediately after scouring, the maker of woolen yarn
will buy wool that has been scoured months before. Most of the wool
that is scoured by or near the growers finds its way into the woolen industry
for this reason. The scouring given to clothing wool varies only
in that it is more violent than that given to combing wool, and in that it
is frequently augmented by carbonization to remove vegetable matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>
<br>
<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image082" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image082.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Mule Spinning</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Blending</em></div>

<p>The first process after scouring is blending. When the desired mixture
of various grades, kinds, and colors of wool, wool extract, or cotton has
been effected, the resulting heterogeneous mass is put through the first
of several carding processes.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Fibres not
parallel as
in Worsted</em></div>

<p>From now on the desire of the woolen yarn manufacturer is diametrically
opposed to that of the worsted comber. He wants to open out the
fibres, but he wants them to lie in all directions. He does not want uniformity.
He wants just the opposite. His yarn must have a certain
amount of strength, but it must have, first of all, felting properties, so
that when the cloth is finished the various threads will merge and interlock.
As might be expected, therefore, the carding process is very much
more violent.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Carding</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Condenser</em></div>

<p>The blend is first put through a fearnought which might be described
briefly as the most pitiless member of the card family. It is also known
as a tenter-hook-willy, from the reversed position of its teeth. From this
machine the wool goes through the card proper, which is similar to the
worsted card except that the rollers go in opposite directions, instead of
in the same directions. Here, again, the doffer lifts the wool off in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
continuous filmy sheet and delivers it to the condenser. The sheet is not
simply drawn through a funnel into a single thick sliver, but is forced
between rollers into two leather rubbing aprons which by pressure and
friction reduce it to a series of small soft flabby slivers, having just
enough adhesiveness to permit of mule spinning.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p>The fibres in these slivers may be of all lengths and degrees of fineness,
and they lie in all directions.</p>

<p>There are now no elaborate drawing or combing processes. All that
remains to be done before we have a weavable woolen yarn is a certain
amount of twisting and attenuation. Both these results are obtained at
once in the mule.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mule
Spinning</em></div>

<p>In a woolen mule the spools of sliver are placed in a fixed frame, and
the sliver passes between a pair of rollers to the spindles. These stand,
slightly inclined backwards, in a long row upon the movable carriage.
At first the spindle tips are close to the rollers. The sliver is paid out,
and at the same time the carriage bearing the revolving spindles retreats.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
During this time no yarn is wound on the bobbins, but the slivers are
being twisted. Then the rollers cease to pay out sliver, the carriage
moves out a little further, and the spindles rotate faster, so that the yarn
is being twisted and stretched. When sufficient twist has been imparted
the carriage moves back again and the spindles wind up the twisted yarn
on to the bobbins. This, briefly, is the operation of the mule. There are
a great many intricate devices in this machine which deserve attention,
but which hardly fall within our scope. All that remains now is to wind
the yarn on spools, or skein it, before it is ready for the weaver.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Manufacture of Woolen Cloth</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Weaving</em></div>

<p>There are many differences between weaving worsteds and woolens,
but for our purposes we may consider the process the same, as in a
general way it is. Some cloths are woven with a cotton warp and a
woolen yarn filling, the warp being carefully concealed. Woolen cloths
are more frequently woven with a backing than worsteds. This means
that either there is a double warp, a double weft, or both. The object of
backing is usually to add strength and warmth to the material, and the
lower side is therefore often woven of coarser yarn. In some cases, however,
notably in travelling rugs, the backing may be just as elaborate as
the face, and this necessitates a rather intricate mounting process.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Carpets</em></div>

<p>Carpet weaving is one of the large branches of the woolen industry,
and for this purpose the coarsest and longest fibred wools (common,
braid, and carpet wools) are usually employed. These wools readily
lend themselves to the manufacture of a coarse thick yarn, which in turn
produces a thick, durable material. The thickness of a carpet is known
as the pile.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Finishing
Important
in Woolens</em></div>

<p>Whereas we saw that the worsted cloth was practically finished when
it left the loom, this is not the case with woolens. Oftentimes it would
tax an expert to identify the finished goods with the loose and altogether
different material produced by the weaver. Some fine woolens, it is true,
are scarcely altered more than worsteds, but in most cases the finishing
operations are in this industry a major rather than a subsidiary stage of
manufacture. The reader may have been puzzled at the divergent lines
along which woolen and worsted yarns are manufactured, and at a loss
to account for the reasons. The cause is precisely this, that the worsted
manufacturer aims to produce a cloth that is completed when woven,
while the woolen maker wants his loom to turn out a material that will
readily adopt a great variety of finishes.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Burling</em></div>

<p>The first finishing operation, which applies also to worsteds, is the
examination of the piece for imperfections and the removing of them by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
hand. The piece is then scoured to get rid of dirt, and, where the finish
is complicated, this may be repeated several times.</p>

<br>
<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="image085" style="max-width: 50.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image085.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Fulling</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Fulling</em></div>

<p>Fulling, the next and very important process, consists in passing the
material through closed or partially enclosed boxes, in which the cloth
is run through soap solutions and then forced through rollers. The result
of fulling is to shrink the material and give more body to it. It is
chiefly in order to be able to do this that the maker of woolens wants the
fibres in his yarn to lie criss-cross, so that in the fulling mill their serrated
edges will felt and interlock with each other. The amount of fulling
done depends upon the shrinkage desired. It is possible to reduce the
size of the cloth by half in this process. Some worsteds are slightly
fulled, but in their case it simply serves to add a little body to the cloth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
without in any way sacrificing the design of the weaving. Long before
the invention of even the earliest automatic textile machinery there were
great numbers of water-driven fulling mills, in which the woolen cloth
was pounded in fuller’s earth by wooden hammers. In those days the
cloth was felted into a stiff thick mass which would resist wear almost
indefinitely, but which would hardly adapt itself to the requirements of
modern tailoring.</p>

<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Raising</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Cropping</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Pressing</em></div>

<p>The fulled piece is next made to revolve on a large drum set with
teazle-heads. The object of this procedure is to open out the fibres, and
the process is known as raising. In worsteds and fancy woolens, such as
trouserings, raising is really nothing more than the brushing up of the
loose fibres so that they may be cropped off, much as grass is cut on a
lawn. This will of course have the effect of showing up the weave very
plainly. In most woolens, however, the cloth is raised wet, and the teazle
motion is more violent, so that the entire surface is covered with a thick
nap of brushed up fibres which entirely conceal the weave. This is often
very desirable where coarse backing threads are to be hidden, or where,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
for other reasons, a thick nap is desired, as for instance in rough overcoatings.
There may be several raisings and croppings, between which
the material is boiled and pressed, all depending on the character of the
face that is desired. In some cloths the finishing processes are exceedingly
complicated, particularly where a smooth finish such as doeskin is
sought. The variety of finishes is infinite and new ones are constantly
being invented, many of which are closely guarded trade secrets. In
most cases pressing completes the process.</p>

<br>

<p>We have now followed both the combing and the clothing wools
through the process of manufacture into worsted and woolen yarns and
cloths. Again, let us emphasize that the relative amount of space devoted
here to the two industries is governed, not by their comparative importance,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
but by what appeared to be the most concise method of approach.
Many details, which loom up as tremendous problems to the manufacturer,
have necessarily been treated here with scant respect, and others
have not even been mentioned.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Mohair and Alpaca</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Mohair</em></div>

<p>There are two materials upon which we have not touched at all, although
they are generally included in wool manufacture. Mohair is the
hair of the Angora goat, and has many characteristics of both hair and
Mohair wool. These animals are native to Asia Minor, but are now extensively
raised in other parts of the world, notably in Africa and in this country.
The hair averages about four inches in length, although it frequently
grows much longer, is very smooth and fine, has considerable tensile
strength, low elasticity, and practically no felting property. It is used
primarily in the manufacture of plush, such as is used in railroad carriages,
and makes very durable material. It is also woven into Palm
Beach cloth, or mixed with worsted or cotton yarns in such fabrics as
automobile tops.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Alpaca</em></div>

<p>Alpaca is a similar fibre, obtained from an animal native to Bolivia
and Peru. The fibre is finer than mohair, and a little more like wool. It
comes in three natural colors; white, brown, and black, all of which are
found on the same fleece. Alpaca is both light and soft, and therefore
lends itself admirably to the manufacture of thin linings.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Knitting and Felt Manufacture</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Stockinette
Frame</em></div>

<p>Whereas most wool yarn is woven into cloth, there is also the knitting
process, in which the individual threads are interlaced into a regular
fabric without warp and weft structure. The work is performed on a
sort of loom, called the stockinette frame, upon which the yarns are
arranged in parallel order and uniform distances apart. The actual knitting
closely resembles hand knitting, and is done entirely by automatic
mechanism. A machine of this sort is capable of turning out a great
length of material in a short time, and the fabric has the fine ribbed
character seen in ordinary knitted goods. The article is soft, full, and
elastic, but lacks the strength and firmness of woven fabrics. Stockinette
cloths, sweaters, some underwear, and hosiery are products of the knitting
machine, and the knitting mills are important consumers of noils
and low-grade wools.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Felt</em></div>

<p>Besides being made into yarn, and woven or knit into goods, wool is
also compressed into felts of various kinds. Space unfortunately is
lacking for the consideration of this subject here, although a considerable
quantity of wool goes into felt manufacture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV-2">CHAPTER IV<br>
THE ECONOMIC ASPECT</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Financial Risks</span></h3>

<p>Bearing in mind the industrial structure we have just outlined, it
might be well for us to glance briefly at its financial scaffolding. From
the banker’s point of view there are many features which are distinctive
of the wool trade, and which exercise an important bearing upon the
judgment of a credit risk.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sheep
Banks</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Sheep
Risks</em></div>

<p>To begin with the grower, we find here that in many instances the
large raisers of sheep have built up their own banks. In Texas, for instance,
there are a considerable number of banks whose chief business
consists in financing the wool clips of their sections. On the other extreme
we have the small grower of the East, who is frequently at the
mercy of the local store-keeper. Where wool growing is practised on a
large scale in this country the tendency is more and more to reduce the
business to a scientifically standardized scale, in such a manner as is
prevalent in Australia. The more this is done the more independent the
grower becomes, and the easier it is for a bank to determine the strength
of the individual risk. The sheep raiser has of course one primary asset,
his flocks; and if he is compelled to borrow, the security behind his note
rests upon his sheep. In making a loan to a sheep man a bank has to consider
not only the market value of the animals, but the conditions under
which they are being raised. Sheep are affected by droughts, for instance,
and many flocks have been ravaged by predatory animals, or
decimated by disease. Any one of these contingencies may at any moment
destroy or depreciate the bank’s collateral, and for this reason
borrowing of this sort is confined very largely to banks situated in
sheep-growing sections which specialize in this form of loan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Grower’s
Cost</em></div>

<p>It would be of great interest to figure the average cost of production
per pound of wool to the grower, but, with the varying conditions encountered
in different parts of the country and with sundry breeds, an
accurate estimate can hardly be arrived at. Even the cost of shearing is
variously figured from ten to nearly thirty cents. Generally speaking,
however, the grower needs very little financial assistance, because he is
able to sell his entire clip for cash. The buyers representing merchants—or
in a few cases, mills—are prepared to pay cash for their wool, and
in some cases where they feel sure of a rising market, often go so far as
to buy the wool on the sheep’s back before it is shorn. Provided the
grower knows something about wool, and the existing demand, there is
no reason why, from the proceeds of one clip, he should not be able to
meet his costs up to the time of the next shearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The Merchant</em></div>

<p>The merchant is up against a very different proposition. As we have
seen, he buys for cash, and not only sells on credit, but carries a large
proportion of what he buys for several months, before he can dispose of
it. There are so many kinds of wool merchants that it is almost impossible
to make any general observations. One merchant, for example, may
specialize entirely in domestic wools; in that case he would do all his
buying in the spring months and would gradually dispose of his material,
having first graded it, during the remainder of the year. Another
house might do the bulk of its business in South American wools, which
would mean a fall purchasing season. Still another would handle both
domestic and South American, and a fourth might import from all parts
of the world, so that buying and selling would be going on continuously
and at the same time throughout the year. The credit requirements of the
first two houses would be an easier demand upon the bank than those of
the latter, but in all cases the judging of the risk involves certain primary
considerations, each of which really necessitates the close study of
the individual case.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Credit Risks</em></div>

<p>A wool merchant’s business is largely based on his estimate of the
future. There are no “future” markets for wool as there are for cotton
and silk, and the wool dealer cannot therefore protect himself by
hedging. Were it not for the fact that he assumes a risk which neither the
grower nor, in most cases, the manufacturer is able to take, he could not
maintain his position as the middleman. The merchant’s buyer must, as
we have seen, be able to judge the amount of shrinkage within a very
small fraction, he must know the demand for each quality of wool so
that he may be sure not to pay more than he can sell for, and, what is
more, he must be able to forecast the future with a certain amount of accuracy
in order to make his profit. Furthermore, the merchant must be
constantly on his guard against doing more business than his capital
warrants, while at the same time, unless he makes every dollar work, his
business will in normal times fail to show him a profit.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Merchant
Manufacturers</em></div>

<p>Some wool dealers have become considerably more than middlemen,
and have gone quite extensively into the first stages of manufacture.
This is particularly true of some of the large houses which of recent
years have established top manufacturing departments, and which therefore
sell a large proportion of their goods not as raw wool but as tops
and noil.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Brokers</em></div>

<p>Although the dealers do the bulk of the commission work in consignment
sales, there are a great number of brokers whose function is primarily
the buying and selling for account of others. These houses usually
operate with a limited capital, and are not extensive seekers of
credit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Mills</em></div>

<p>So far as the manufacturers, or mills of various sorts, are concerned,
there is one striking difference about the paper of woolen and worsted
mills as against cotton mill notes which appear in the open market;
cotton mill paper, except in the case of the strongest mills, usually bears
the endorsement of the commission house which sells the mill’s product,
but this is not as a rule the case with woolen and worsted mill paper.
The reason is that a large number of the wool manufacturing establishments
sell direct to wholesalers and jobbers, and have no close affiliation
with a selling-house.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Trade
Terms</em></div>

<p>Trade terms vary a good deal. Raw wool is almost invariably sold for
cash by the grower. Dealers make various terms to mills, the most usual
being 1% ten days, sixty days net. The terms on which mills sell to jobbers
also have a wide range; some sell thirty days net, some 10% thirty
days, others 7% four months.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Demand and Supply</span></h3>

<p>Sheep raising is, as we have seen, chiefly carried on on the borderlines
of civilization. As civilized life encroaches upon the pasture lands
the flocks are driven gradually further and further into hitherto uninhabited
regions. The population of the world is steadily increasing,
and the available grazing acres are constantly being reduced as the
world becomes more thickly populated. Also, as the population increases,
the demand for clothing and food increases, so that, on the face
of it, it would seem that the production of wool would decrease while
the demand grew constantly larger. In a measure this is true; but there
are several factors which tend to arrest this Malthusian spectre. In the
first place, there are still vast areas of desert land which can be reclaimed
for grazing purposes. In the second place the growing of wool
in most countries is as yet practiced on a very crude and consequently
uneconomical scale. And, finally, the use of shoddy and wool regained
from rags, has only begun to be developed. Nor is it true that sheep
must necessarily be raised in uncultivated regions; England, with her
closely settled soil, supports about three-fifths as many sheep as the
United States, on an area of only 121,377 square miles, as against the
3,026,789 square miles in this country.</p>

<p>The world’s total output of wool in 1921 is estimated at three billion,
three million pounds, as against two billion, eight hundred and ninety-four
million pounds in 1918. The production of the 1921 crop was divided
as follows: Europe 899 million pounds, Australia 718 million
pounds, South America 592 million pounds, Asia 327 million pounds,
North America 298 million pounds, Africa 169 million pounds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span></p>

<p>The following table will show the amount of wool produced and
imported in the United States between the years of 1897 and 1922:</p>

THE RAW MATERIAL</h2>
</div>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">History</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Early
Sericulture</em></div>

<p>Silk owes its position as one of the three leading textiles to its qualities
of strength, elasticity and beauty—in which respects it surpasses
all other fabrics. Its production dates far into antiquity; for centuries
China was the seat of the industry, guarding the secret methods and
processes with the utmost care. During the sixth and seventh centuries
A. D. the secret began to leak out and sericulture gradually found root
in the Near East and the Levant, whence it spread to Greece, Italy,
France and Spain. Japan also took it up and developed it to a very high
point.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Industry
in
America</em></div>

<p>Attempts to establish the industry in America have been generally
unsuccessful, high costs precluding the possibility of competing with
foreign conditions. In addition, the raising of raw silk has been built
up principally in countries where there is a system of home industry—a
social and industrial system never developed in the United States. However,
although America has never been a factor in the producing of the
raw material, it has risen to a place of utmost importance in the manufacture
of the finished textile. Immense quantities of raw silk are imported
from abroad—principally Japan, Italy, and China—and its conversion
into the finished products constitutes a most important part of
our industry.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">The Silk Worm</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Names and
Types of
Silk Worms</em></div>

<p>The textile fibre known as silk is a filament secreted by one of two
general types of moth larvæ—the cultivated and the wild. The largest
proportion is, of course, made up of the former, produced by the worm
known as the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyx mori</i>, while the most common type of wild silk
worm is called the Tussah. The name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyx mori</i> comes from the
name of the family to which the silk worm belongs: the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombycidoe</i>
(spinners), and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">mori</i>, from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">morus multicaulis</i> or mulberry tree, on
the leaves of which it feeds. The species <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sericaria mori</i>, or silk worm of
the mulberry, belongs to the generic class of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lepidoptera</i> or scaly-winged
insects.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyx Mori</i></div>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyx mori</i>, with which we are chiefly concerned, is divided
into other groups according to the cycle of reproduction. The annuals
reproduce once a year, and sixty per cent of the silk worms belong to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
this class. The bivoltines reproduce twice a year, and the polyvoltines,
several times during the year, the first crop being the best.</p>
<br>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Full Grown Worms</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The study and development of the various phases through which the
silk worm passes, leading up to its production of the actual filament,
have been a subject of intense research in many parts of the world for
a great number of centuries. The present silk worm is nothing more than
a highly specialized product of a long train of artificial cultivation.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Stages of
Growth</em></div>

<p>The cultivated silk worm passes through four changes in its life of
two months, i.e., egg, larva, chrysalis (or pupa), and adult—a cream-white
moth which is about one inch in length. The moths live only a few
days, during which mating takes place, and the female lays several hundred
eggs; after about six months these eggs hatch into worms. The latter
pass through what are known as four “molts,” or shedding of the
skin, before the worm matures, spins its cocoon, becomes a chrysalis,
and finally emerges as a moth. This, very briefly, is the life history of
the silk worm.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Modern Sericulture</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Countries
Producing
Raw Silk</em></div>

<p>Silk raising, or sericulture, has been a leading industry in Japan and
China for a great many years, while the Near East and such countries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
as France and Italy have also played a part in the industry—but to a
lesser degree. A great deal of this work, particularly in Japan and
China, has been carried on as a home industry, but with the growth of
modern business methods more and more of the silk raising has come
into the hands of companies operating on a highly scientific basis.</p>

<br>
<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image099" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image099.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Cocoonery</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Japanese
Supervision</em></div>

<p>After many years of experience and experimentation the breeding
and care of the silk worm has been put on a very technical and closely
regulated schedule that minimizes the chances of loss by waste or the
spread of disease. In Japan the industry has been encouraged and
fostered by the Government; a special division of the administration is
devoted to its attention, and numerous organizations and associations
conduct experimental stations for research and study. In fact since
about the middle of the 19th century everything possible has been done
to foster this highly profitable branch of the country’s industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Modern
Methods of
Cultivation</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Hatching
the Eggs</em></div>

<p>The merest outline of the modern methods of cultivation will show
how highly they have been developed. To begin with, the eggs are
placed on sheets of paper or muslin directly after they are laid. These
sheets are hung for a few days in a damp atmosphere, and then
placed in cold storage for about six months, the period of cold being
advantageous for later hatching, which is done by heat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Growth of
the Worms</em></div>

<p>After hatching, the worm sheds its skin four times. The periods between
the “molts,” or ages, vary with different silk worms, but the total
process takes about a month. Worms of different ages are always kept
separate, being held on large cloth trays which are carried in tiers along
the walls of the rearing rooms. The cocooneries where best results are
obtained are quiet, spacious, well-ventilated rooms where an even temperature
can be maintained. Each worm is kept absolutely clean and has
plenty of room, as overcrowding brings disease. As a precaution mild
fumigation is resorted to from time to time. Heavy odors or smoke of
any sort are not allowed, as these are disturbing to the worms.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Feeding
the Worms</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>The
Mulberry
Tree</em></div>

<p>Nourishment is, of course, a very important item for the growing
worms, and the best form of food for the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyx mori</i> is the leaf of
the white mulberry, which must be young, fresh and dry, but never
withered. For this purpose mulberry tree raising has become an important
by-industry in itself. Three varieties are found, classified according
to the time of budding—early, medium and late. The leaves, therefore,
can be found in the correct condition for the various stages in the
growth of the worm. The late budding trees are cultivated in more
abundance, as the worms are larger at that time and consume more
leaves. The soil in which the trees grow is important, as it has been
found that one which is rich in certain minerals provides leaves that
keep the worms in better physical condition. A cold winter followed by
a warm spring develops the leaves well, and the condition of the leaves
is one of the most important factors in the whole process.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Early
Development</em></div>

<p>Careful selection of the eggs is another matter of prime importance.
When the leaves are almost ready, the eggs are brought out of cold storage
and subjected to heat for about a month before they hatch out.
When the worm hatches it is about the diameter of a hair and less than
three-fourths of an inch long. It gnaws a hole through the end of the
egg from which it issues. Nourishment at first is taken by sucking the
sap of the leaves, which are at this stage chopped into fine pieces; later
the leaves are consumed without the necessity of their being chopped up.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Spinning
the Cocoon</em></div>

<p>The development is very rapid, the worms consuming their own
weight daily. During this period, as has been stated, they shed their
skins four times, and after the fourth molt—about one month after
hatching—they have assumed their full size. From then on hunger
lessens, restlessness grows, and the lifting of the fore part of the body
indicates the desire to climb and spin cocoons. For this purpose brush
and twigs are provided in the trays, to which the worms attach themselves
and begin the spinning process. The silk thread is expelled in a
semi-liquid form from two openings underneath the mouth, hardening
as it comes in contact with the air. The first threads issued are coarse
and rough, having the necessary strength to serve as supports and guys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span>
for the cocoon. Gradually the worm is enclosed in the cocoon after three
days of continuous spinning, during one of which it is visible and then
slowly disappears, though it can be heard working inside.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Worms Feeding</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The worm wastes away as its silk glands are exhausted, and becomes
a chrysalis, from which the moth escapes after fifteen to twenty days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span></p>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Cocoons for
Breeding</em></div>

<p>Cocoons to be used for silk manufacture must be submitted to heat
soon after they are completed, in order to kill the chrysalis and prevent
it from forcing its way out, thus breaking the fibres. A certain proportion
of the cocoons of each crop, however, is allowed to go through the
natural process, for reproductive purposes. There is an active market in
these breeding cocoons, particularly in Japan and China, and a large
quantity are exported annually to Europe and the Near East.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Construction
of the
Silk Thread</em></div>

<p>The female cocoon is oval and the male cocoon is peanut shaped. The
silk itself consists of two parts: fibroin (the silk fibre) and sericin (the
gum). The thread is made up of two strands of fibre held together by
the gum, and the length of thread in a single cocoon varies from three
hundred to fourteen hundred yards. The cocoons are white, yellowish,
or greenish, but after the boiling process the color of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bombyx mori</i>
silk is pure white.</p>

latter type, from which the largest proportion of the world’s silk supply
is derived, but in a general way it applies to the other types also. The
most important of these are the Tussah silk of India and China and the
Japanese wild silk. The products are coarser and harsher than those of

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Vaucanson’s

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Silk Manufacture
in
Europe</em></div>

<p>The next step in the production of silk is called reeling, and for this
purpose the modern filature has been developed. The actual existence of
reeling machines is by no means modern, however, for it is a well-known
fact that the Chinese knew how to use raw silk as far back as
5000 years ago. Old prints dating back 3000 years show that the hand
“reelers” then in use differed little in principle from the highly developed
filatures of today. Although China knew how to reel and twist silk
for several thousand years, it was only in the third, fourth, and fifth
centuries A. D. that other countries, such as Japan and Eastern Europe,
took it up. The first filatures were, of course, extremely simple, operated
entirely by hand, and produced a very coarse thread. Although a little
progress was made during the Middle Ages, the turning point came in
1750 when Vaucanson, a French engineer, invented the first real filature—which
combined several reelers, giving the whole process more speed
and turning out a product of considerably better quality. This marked
the beginning of Europe’s interest in what had so long been an exclusively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
Oriental industry, and from then on the French, Italians and
Spanish in particular took up the study of sericulture and the reeling
and manufacturing process. The result was to put the industry on a
scientific basis which it had never reached in the East.</p>

<br>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Preparing to Reel</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote">“<em>Stoving</em>”</div>

<p>The reeling process is the first step in which machinery plays an
important part. When the cocoons are ready they must first be submitted
to the “stoving” process, or stifling, in which they are exposed to heat
sufficient to kill the chrysalis inside. This is followed by further drying,
after which the cocoons are shipped in bags to the filatures and may be
kept indefinitely without injuring the filament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel">“<em>Beating</em>”</div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Waste
Material</em></div>

<p>As a preliminary to reeling, the cocoons are immersed in boiling
water to soften the gum that holds the fibre together. While in the water
they are brushed with a coarse brush to remove the heavy outer strands
of the cocoon—a process called “beating.” These outer strands are
usually too harsh and broken to be reeled, but are afterwards utilized as
so-called waste which is used for spun-silk manufacture.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> This applies
also to the innermost layers of the cocoon. About one-half of the thread
on a cocoon actually finds its way into thrown silk. The remainder is
“waste.” When, by brushing, the true threads are reached it is possible
to start reeling, and barring occasional breaks these threads are continuous
all the way down to the chrysalis.</p>

</div>

<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Modern Reeling Methods</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Reeling
Basins</em></div>

<p>While being reeled the cocoons are floated in basins of very hot
water, each basin feeding a reeling machine. A single cocoon strand is
too fine to use commercially, so several are taken at a time, varying
from three to seven or eight according to the size of thread desired. The
size used in this country most extensively is known as <span class="xs"><sup>13</sup>/<sub>15</sub></span> deniers and
is reeled from six or seven cocoons. During the reeling the water is kept
at about 60° C., but if the cocoons are very dry a higher temperature is
required. A heavy smoke issues from the basins and not only humidifies
the room but also penetrates the silk, rendering it very gummy and hard.
This is overcome by the use of steam-heated tubes running over and
around the machines.</p>

<p>Each reeling machine and basin is in charge of a girl who is responsible
for its operation and for the reeling of thread of correct size. She
must keep careful watch that the filament comes off the cocoons steadily
and that all breaks are immediately taken care of, exhausted cocoons
being replaced by new ones at the proper time. In many filatures each
girl is charged with so many cocoons and must turn in a proportionate
amount of reeled silk at the end of the day.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Twisting</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Human
Element</em></div>

<p>The twisting operation is an important part of the reeling process,
for the raw silk threads, being composed of parallel cocoon filaments,
cohering only by their natural gum, would, unless twisted, mat up and
become unworkable. Various methods are used to obtain this torque, the
general idea in each case being to run the separate cocoon threads
through small rings or eyes and then unite them in one thread large
enough to reel. In spite of the many mechanical devices and improvements
brought out in the last few years, the success of the reeling operation
still is dependent on the reeling girl’s ability and care. It is
particularly important that she be able to judge the number of cocoons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
of a certain size and texture needed to make a thread of the required
denier.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Testing
the Skeins</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Color of
Raw Silk</em></div>

<p>The raw silk is reeled on travellers in hanks known as skeins and
varying from 50 to 100 grams in weight, which are taken off by the reeling
girl and the ends of the thread tied up to facilitate the work at the
mill. Before leaving the filature it is also subjected to critical tests and
examinations for size, winding, cleanliness, irregularities, etc. The color
of raw silk as it comes off the cocoon and is reeled into skeins is either
white or yellow, though some sorts have a brownish or greenish tinge.
Tussah silks have a brownish-yellow color. The coloring matter in the
cultivated silks is only in the gum and boils out with it, but the color in
the tussah is in the fibre, rendering it very difficult to bleach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<br>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Reeling
Wild Silk</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Waste Silk</em></div>

<p>Tussah, or wild silk, is not generally reeled by the wet reel process,
as the cocoons are apt to be closed up at each end by gum. In China this
gum is softened by burying the cocoons in manure instead of immersing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
them in hot water. This is known as dry reeling. It very often happens
that the tussah cocoons are unfit for reeling, due to being pierced or
tangled. Silk from these imperfect cocoons is again classed as “waste,”
along with the frisons, or outside and inmost layers of the cultivated
cocoons, which, as has been stated, are used to make spun silk. In this
country waste silk is often called schappe, although strictly speaking
this name should only be applied to waste silk degummed by the
French process of fermentation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Baling</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Picul
Bale</em></div>

<p>The raw silk, having been reeled and twisted into skeins, is next
marked and tied together in bundles of skeins known as “books” each
bearing the mark or “chop” of its grade. These are packed in bales for
shipment, the weight of the bales varying in different countries. In
Japan and China they are called picul bales and weigh 133⅓ pounds.
Italian silks, on the other hand, are packed in shipping bales of about
200 pounds.</p>


<h3>4. <span class="smcap">Sources of Raw Silk</span></h3>

<p>Of the countries producing raw silk, Japan and China occupy the
leading positions by a large margin, the former contributing roughly
one half of the world’s supply, and the latter about one third. Italy
ranks a poor third with about one tenth, and France, the Near East,
India, Spain and the Balkans contribute the balance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Japan</em></div>

<p>Although the greater part of the raw silk produced in the various
countries is exported for manufacture abroad, a certain percentage is
retained for home spinning and weaving. It is estimated that about 65
per cent of the Japanese output is exported, approximately 90 per cent.
of which goes to the United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>China</em></div>

<p>In China over one half of the output is held for domestic consumption,
the remainder being divided about equally between Europe and
America.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Italy</em></div>

<p>The Italian raw silk—a very high quality product—finds its largest
market in France, principally in the city of Lyons, the silk center of
Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Yokohama
Silk Exchange</em></div>

<p>The Yokohama Raw Silk Exchange operates on a basis similar to
that of the various cotton exchanges, and transactions are carried on in
“futures” as far ahead as five months. The speculative element is very
active and its influence is often felt extensively throughout all phases
of the industry. On several occasions it has been necessary to close
the exchange to avert real disaster after the quotations have been
manipulated to an unbelievable extent. During the last few years the
Japanese Government and various silk organizations have, by law and
regulation, succeeded in improving this situation to a very great degree,
and the benefit has been felt throughout the industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Conditioned
Weight</em></div>

<p>Raw silk is sold by weight—in Yokohama, by net weight, that is,
less wrappings, etc. Of recent years in most countries it has been the
custom to deal by conditioned weight, and as a result the conditioning
process has become an important side line in the industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span></p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Conditioning</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Invoice
Weight</em></div>

<p>Conditioning is desirable principally on account of the fact that raw
silk absorbs considerable moisture. A careless buyer may find after
delivery that he has purchased more water than he has silk. To avoid
this possibility, Asiatic and European markets in particular have
adopted the conditioned weight basis—absolute dry weight plus 11 per
cent moisture. Quotations are often given on invoice weight, which is
conditioned weight plus a 2% margin for variation.</p>

<p>A conditioning house, besides examining for weight, also conducts
numerous other tests necessary to conditioned silk. The main factors
taken into consideration, besides weight, are size, color, cleanliness,
boil-off, winding strength, elasticity, and general uniformity.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Weight</em></div>

<p>As regards size, the unit is the denier, an ancient French weight equal
to .05 gram; the size is measured by the weight in deniers of 450 meters
of the thread. As previously stated, the <span class="xs"><sup>13</sup>/<sub>15</sub></span> denier size is the standard
used in the United States, although the larger and smaller grades are
dealt in to some extent for special types of products. Size is always
given as averaging between certain deniers (such as 13 to 15) as it is
impossible to attain absolute accuracy in reeling, and slight variations
cannot be avoided, either within the bales or within the skeins themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Color</em></div>

<p>The color test is concerned merely with uniformity in shade, which
makes accurate dyeing possible. The cultivated silks are either pure
white or yellow, according to the variety of cocoon from which they are
derived.</p>

<div class="sidenotel">“<em>Boil off</em>”</div>

<p>The term “boil off” refers to the amount or percentage of gum on the
filament. As explained before, the individual strands of fibre adhere
together through a gummy substance secreted by the worm. The amount
found in the reeled silk varies with different kinds from 10 to 25 per
cent by weight—which is brought down to a minimum by the boiling
process.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Winding
Strength</em></div>

<p>Winding strength is measured by the breaks that occur in winding.
In this country the test is based on the number of breaks occurring in 30
or more skeins wound at the rate of about 120 yards per minute. This
test is extremely important since a weak thread can do much to hinder
an efficient re-reeling process, inasmuch as each break stops the machine
and must be tied by the operator.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Grading and Quotations</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Classification</em></div>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Difficulties
in Grading</em></div>

<p>The question of classification of raw silk for market and the various
terms used for its purchase and sale is a complicated one. Standardization<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
has been sought after for a good many years and committees both
here and abroad have studied the problem on various occasions—but
without entirely satisfactory results. The chief source of trouble appears
to lie the many types of variation that may occur, not only on account
of the great number of qualities required in the product, but also due to
the varying conditions under which the silk is produced. In the early
days of the industry, when farm production was the chief source of
supply, particularly in Japan and China, satisfactory grading was almost
an impossibility. However, now that sericulture and reeling has
come more and more into the hands of the large companies and filatures,
a greater degree of standardization can be reached.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV-3">CHAPTER IV<br>
MANUFACTURE OF THROWN AND SPUN SILK</h2>
</div>

<p>We have covered in the preceding chapters the culture of raw silk,
its reeling, and finally its marketing in the countries where it is to be
manufactured into the finished textile. We now come to the mechanical
phases of the industry, by which raw silk is made first into yarn and
then into fabric. Whereas, in the case of cotton and wool, we have seen
that yarn is manufactured by various modifications of the spinning
process, this is not true in the case of silk. The spinning process is here
supplanted by an operation known as “throwing,” and is resorted to
only in the manufacture of yarn from the various kinds of silk waste.</p>


<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Thrown Silk</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Necessity
for
Throwing</em></div>

<p>The ordinary raw silk, as it comes from the filature and is sold in
the market, is composed of from two to eight filaments adhering together
by virtue of the natural gum secreted by the worm. This thread
is too thin and delicate for many uses and so must be submitted to
further twisting and doubling—a process called “throwing.” It must be
borne in mind, however, that there are several types of fabrics in which
raw silk is used without going through the throwing operation. This is
usually the case, for example, with the warp threads for crepes,
charmeuse, and messaline.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“<em>Throwsters</em>”</div>

<p>Although some of the larger silk mills have their own departments
for this process, as a general rule it is done by independent concerns
known as “throwsters”—who specialize in this particular operation.
Machinery of a very complicated and accurate type is necessary, capable
of operating at very high speed. It has been found that the investment
called for to equip such a mill is too large in most cases to allow
the manufacturers to incorporate this operation in their factories, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
if it happens that the spindles are not fully employed during
the whole of the year.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="image116" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/image116.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent"><em>Throwing Machines</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Organzine
and
Tram</em></div>

<p>There are two main classes of thrown silk—organzine and tram—the
former has a heavy twist and is used for the warp; while the latter is
given only a light twist and is used for filling. Within these two general
types there are many special grades, according to the type of material
for which they are to be used, such as crepe, chiffon, sewing thread, floss
silk, embroidery silk, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Soaking
the Raw
Silk</em></div>

<p>The raw silk as it comes to the throwing mill is done up in books of
skeins and packed in bales, as described in a previous chapter. The
skeins, after being weighed and examined, are first soaked for about
twelve hours in warm soapy water, which softens the natural gum, after
which they are thoroughly dried. This, of course, reduces the moisture
content below the customary 11 per cent, which is later restored by
natural absorption.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Winding</em></div>

<p>The first step in the actual throwing is the winding of the thread on
bobbins. The skeins are put on swifts—a light type of reel—and wound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
at a very high rate of speed on the proper size of bobbin. It is here that
the winding strength of the silk meets its severest test, for constant
breaks during the winding involve considerable expense when speed is
such an important factor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Twisting</em></div>

<p>The bobbins of silk are next taken to the twister, which combines two
or more strands and gives the thread the necessary amount of twist for
the special type that is desired. In the case of tram a very light twist is
given, about two or three turns to the inch. For organzine the single
threads are first given sixteen turns to an inch in one direction, then
doubled and twisted fourteen turns in the other direction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Crepe</em></div>

<p>Twisting is the basis of the manufacture of the various kinds of crepe.
The filling or tram used is given a very hard twist, about sixty-five turns
to the inch—either in right or left-hand direction. These threads are
later woven alternately and so produce the crinkled effect.</p>

<p>Thrown silk is classified in a similar way to raw silk, except that
usually market quotations on thrown silks mention not only the classification
but also the purpose for which it is to be used (tram or organzine),
the size in deniers, the number of threads and twists to the inch.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Spun Silk</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Spinning
Waste
Silk</em></div>

<p>The above processes refer only to throwing of raw silk. In the case of
waste, schappe, frisons, etc., an entirely different method must be used,
comprising a series of operations very similar to the carding, combing
and spinning of wool.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The gum, of which silk waste contains a very
large proportion, must first be boiled off in a hot soapy bath or allowed
to ferment in vats, the latter method being used more generally in
Europe. After degumming, the waste silk is next washed and dried and
allowed to absorb the 11 per cent moisture content, as in the case of the
thrown silk. This is followed by picking, combing, and dressing to remove
any dirt or other foreign matter and to separate the fibres and arrange
them in parallel order.</p>

<p>The silk is next separated into short laps, then drawn out into thin
slivers by means of drawing frames, and thoroughly combed to make
the fibres smooth and uniform. These slivers are finally made suitable
for winding on bobbins by being passed through roving frames. Then
follows the actual spinning process, which twists the roving into yarn.
Different types of yarn are produced by varying the amount of twist and
the number of strands used. Single yarn is made by twisting a single
strand on itself, while for 2-ply, two yarns are twisted together, and so
forth, as in the case of cotton or wool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span></p>

<p>After being cleaned and examined, the yarn is wound into skeins of
about 5 ounces.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Uses of
Spun Silk</em></div>

<p>The principal use of spun silk is in mixed fabrics, in conjunction with
wool, cotton, or raw silk, the spun silk thread generally being used as
filling rather than warp. The better grades are made into velvet and
plush and various types of knit goods. Although high quality spun silk
often has the strength and wearing quality of thrown silk, it never can
compete with the latter in regard to lustre.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Sizing</em></div>

<p>Spun silk is described as to size in one of two general ways. In the
English system the number of the yarn is the number of hanks of 840
yards weighing a pound, with a second number indicating the ply. Thus,
size “20-2” would designate a 2-ply yarn, a pound of which contained
16,800 yards. The French system is more or less on the same principle,
the main difference being that the number of the yarn indicates the
thousands of metres weighing a kilogram.</p>

<p>Thrown and spun silk are bought and sold in very much the same
way as is raw silk, although the market is not as extensive nor is the
volume of trading as large. The following tables of quotations are from
a recent silk journal. A comparison with the quotations given in Chapter
III will show the appreciation in value of the various gradings
through the throwing and spinning processes.</p>

WEAVING AND FINISHING</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Weaving</span></h3>

<p>The manufacture of thrown and spun silk into the finished material,
whether by weaving or knitting, varies with the different types of fabric
desired. But the several processes are based on the same general
principle and are very similar to those used for cotton and wool. To
avoid repetition we would refer to Pages twenty-six to twenty-nine and
Pages thirty-one to thirty-five, where full descriptions will be found.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Finishing</span></h3>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Boiling
Off</em></div>

<p>The first step in the finishing of fabrics is dyeing—unless it has already
been done before weaving. A considerable proportion of silk is
dyed in skein or yarn form before weaving, but in either case the
methods of dyeing are practically the same. Preparatory to dyeing it is
necessary to boil off the natural gum by means of hot soap baths. If the
silk is to be dyed in dark colors a considerable amount of the gum is
allowed to remain. Such silk is known as souple silk and is used principally
for filling. If all the gum has been removed, it is called bright
silk.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Bleaching</em></div>

<p>All silk, after boiling off, should be nearly pure white. Raw silk, as
mentioned in a previous chapter, is often bright yellow, but as this
color is entirely in the gum, it is lost by boiling off. In the case of uneven
coloration in the raw silk, it is necessary to resort to bleaching before
dyeing in order to get uniformity in the finished product. This applies
particularly to wild silks, such as Tussah, which are bleached by
being placed in an air-tight room filled with a chemical preparation,
such as sulphur gas or sodium or hydrogen peroxide. A further washing
and drying is then necessary before the skeins or goods can be
dyed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Dyeing</em></div>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Mordant
Dyes</em></div>

<p>There is no standard dye used for silk, some manufacturers preferring
one type and others, another. It may be said, however, that as a
general rule silk is dyed by the direct method, without the use of an
intermediate or mordant agent as in the case of cotton. This is made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
possible through the natural absorptive powers of silk fibre. Mordant
dyes are sometimes used, it is true, salts of tin or iron being employed
as the agent; but this method is useful principally when it is desired to
weight the silk and restore what was lost in boiling off. As this loss
generally amounts to about 20 or 25 per cent and as raw silk is sold by
weight, it is easy to see that this, unless recovered in some way, would
reduce the manufacturer’s profit considerably.</p>

<br>

</figure>
<br>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Weighting Silk</em></div>

<p>The process of weighting silk has been greatly abused, as it is comparatively
simple to adulterate it, without discovery, to such an extent
that the properties of the fibre are seriously impaired. Weighted silk
never has the strength or wearing quality of the unadulterated product.
However, a certain amount of weighting—to restore a part of the degumming
loss—is generally recognized as legitimate, although the percentage
permissible is often a matter for discussion.</p>

<p>Both skein and piece silk are dyed by being immersed in vats containing
the hot dye solution. The silk is run over rollers which insure even
coloration throughout. After dyeing it is dried, stretched on a tenter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
frame and then submitted to dry heat which sets the dye and adds luster
to the silk.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Printing</em></div>

<p>Printing is also used for coloring and pattern effects in very much the
same way as for cotton goods. After printing the goods are submitted to
a dry steam heat which sets the colors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Finishing</em></div>

<p>Beyond dyeing or printing, silk goods require very little finishing
other than calendaring by passing through rollers. Some types of fabric
require softening and others, hardening—accomplished in a variety of
ways too numerous to describe. Many of these are secret processes perfected
and patented by individual companies. A multitude of different
effects can be obtained by these various treatments of the surface of the
goods.</p>

ARTIFICIAL SILK</h2>
</div>

<h3>1. <span class="smcap">Early Development</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Chardonnet</em></div>

<p>The discovery of what is known as “artificial silk” is generally attributed
to a Frenchman, Count Hilaire de Chardonnet, who after many
years of research and experimentation, between 1840 and 1890, finally
perfected a fibre that possessed the necessary qualities for practical
weaving. He introduced his discovery to the public in 1891 at the
Paris Exposition, and in addition to winning the “Grand Prix” was also
made a knight of the Legion of Honor in recognition of his contribution
to science and industry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Further
Development</em></div>

<p>Since that time others have contributed to the development of the
new fibre and discovered other methods of production—all, however,
based on the same general principle as the Chardonnet process. Despaisses
and Panly, two Frenchmen, and Stearn, Cross and Bevan, Englishmen,
are the outstanding names in this work.</p>


<h3>2. <span class="smcap">Various Processes</span></h3>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Use of
Cellulose</em></div>

<p>All the processes that have met with any success are based on the use
of cellulose in some form, as a foundation. The two sources that have
proved most successful are wood-pulp and cotton and it may be said
that the bulk of the artificial silk on the market comes from one or the
other of these two raw materials.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><em>Chardonnet
Process</em></div>

<p>The Chardonnet process uses cotton as its base. It is first bleached,
then by chemical treatment is changed to nitro-cellulose, which is dissolved
in alcohol and ether and thus made ready for “spinning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Viscose
Process</em></div>

<p>The Viscose process, which has made great strides in recent years,
makes use of a pure grade of sulphite wood-pulp. This pulp is in sheet
form and is first treated with a solution of caustic soda, then shredded
very fine and put through several more chemical treatments, finally being
dissolved in water preparatory to the “spinning.”</p>

<div class="sidenotel">“<em>Spinning</em>”</div>

<p>In both of the above methods the production of the thread is the same.
The solution, whether it be based on cotton or wood-pulp, is forced
through minute holes and comes out in a thread-like stream, which solidifies
when subjected to a setting bath. It is then washed, dried, and
put through processes, such as twisting, reeling, etc., very similar to
those which natural silks undergo.</p>


<h3>3. <span class="smcap">Uses of Artificial Silk</span></h3>

<p>The uses of artificial silk are many and are not entirely confined to
combinations with other textiles. Of recent years the knitting trade has
adopted it extensively, particularly in hosiery, sweater and underwear
manufacture. In weaving, it has proven very successful in combination
with silk or cotton. Large quantities are used in ribbon, electric cord
covering, yarns, threads, etc. It is generally felt that the new fibre does
not directly compete with or replace natural silk, but rather occupies
its own place in the trade on the same basis as the other textiles.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>Growth of
the Industry</em></div>

<p>It has only been during the last fifteen years that artificial silk has
been a very important factor commercially, although for a few years
before that time, small quantities were produced in Europe. Since about
1910 its use has been steadily growing in this country, the importations
from Europe increasing in 1912 from about one and one-half million
pounds to nearly three million pounds in 1914. Since 1910 domestic
production has also become a factor in the market and numerous factories
have been established, the figures for 1923 showing about
33,000,000 pounds output. It is estimated that in 1922 the combined
importations and domestic production amounted to around 20,000,000
pounds, about 50% of the total consumption of natural silk for that
year.</p>

<div class="sidenotel"><em>U. S.
Production</em></div>

<p>The following figures show the production of artificial silk in the
United States in 1913 and between 1920 and 1923:</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
